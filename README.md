# ADS_PROJECT


#This project is to find out whether the reviews left to the workers in gig economy is fair/unfair 
beacuse now-a-days workers are getting affected because of the negative reviews though they are not related to the worker.   
This is done using Sequence classification which uses bert-base-uncased model created by hugging face which has lot of pre-trained models. 
Bert tokenizer is used from pretrained bert-base-model. 
The data for the reviews comes from the Uber website. The dataset is first trained, then validated.
Model's accuracy, recall score, precision score,
