0,I had an accident with an Uber driver in Mexico City. The car that I got into had no side mirror. The Brakes were not working properly either. I almost got into an accident twice. The driver's conversation was unpleasant. Being a foreigner he was very curious to ask where I am from and what brought me to Mexico. I replied to be a tourist and through that conversation is over. He became very rude and asked me if I came to look for a Mexican husband. I never answered and kept quiet. He took the wrong route and made several in requested stops. Having in mind it was uberX. He continued asked me whom I sleep with. He literally stopped the car and asked me to wait for him text someone. I asked him to let me go and take a different driver but he locked the doors and didn't allow me.
1,I have had my account completely hacked to where I cannot sign in or view it. Someone spent over $1k in Uber rides on my credit and debit cards linked to the account and when I dialed the only number available (safety line) I was told I would need to wait until another department emailed me. I didn't hear anything for almost 24 hours and when I did it was a prompted message that did not help at all. It has been almost 2 days and I still have no received a phone call or any helpful support via email. This is a nightmare and the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I am going to be filing a police report to the person who myself and the driver caught fraudulently using my account and looking into an attorney for Uber not making identity theft a priority and rectifying the situation on their end.
1,I requested an 8 mile ride in Boston on a Saturday night around 1:00 am that was coming up around $55 on the app and Lyft was around the same rate. Ended up taking a regular cab that cost me $20. Beware of high rates.
1,Uber is overcharging for Toll fees. When In Florida the Tolls fees estimates between $ .75 to $ 2.00. Uber price shown will be Example $ 16.73 for the ride. After you take the ride you get charge 28.23 and when you check the account it's telling you that you got charge for Tolls. The driver never took the toll route and you try to contact Uber company and they take long to get back to you about the issue of being overcharge. I try to email them and let them know about the extra charges and why am I being charge for a service that I didn't receive.
1,"I had an airport flight today. Uber would not accept my credit card, my Venmo, or my PayPal. As a last resort I brought an Uber gift card to cover my ride to the airport. I'll be damned the Uber App wouldn't even accept their own gift card. My daughter downloaded three of her cards to her app to buy me a ride and sure enough they wouldn't accept her cards either. As a last resort she brought me a ride from Lift with no problem. I'm sending Uber back their gift card certified mail and demanding a refund. After much stress I barely made my flight. I'm also deleting Uber's App and will never, ever use them again. Laura"
1,"In July of this year I had sushi delivered to me in Mexico by UberEats, a subsidiary of Uber, on five occasions. The total cost was 1,918 pesos -- about $100 US. However, I was billed $1,919 dollars(!) on my credit card; something I discovered at the end of the month when paying my credit cards. I contacted Uber Customer Support (Uber does not provide any number to call, so all customer service work has to be through the via email messaging) and I was told that, due this was a glitch in the app and my charges would be refunded."
1,"My driver, Rohan was nice, but when I tried to add tip I noticed that he had switched my $9 9am fare in French Quarter to someone else's 2pm trip in Metairie for $28.00! UBER refused to acknowledge. 5 attempts to rectify problem and received nothing but irrelevant automated replies. If you get in the car with Rohan in NOLA and he says he can't get his system to work, it's a a SCAM. Terrible customer service from UBER with zero relevant assistance after 7 days of requesting corrected bill. BEWARE."
1,"I had seven fraudulent Uber transactions over three days in mid-October on my credit card. For nearly a week, I tried unsuccessfully to get Uber customer service to help. Uber was totally uncooperative. They refused to engage in the fraudulent charges someone in their system imposed on me. I had to cancel my credit card, get a new credit card and leave my credit card company to battle awful Uber. Uber buyer beware. I know I will never use their services again."
0,"Our driver never showed up and Uber cancelled our ride, not us. They charged us a cancellation fee for them cancelling. When I disputed it they would only credit it on future ride instead of refund back to our credit card. Why am I only getting a credit on account instead of a full refund to my credit card used?? This is not right what you have done when it was a Uber error."
1,"When the service worked, it was good, and tech support responds quickly most of the time. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the problems I encountered. The app rejected my credit card and offered no explanation as to why. For some reason it accepted my PayPal even though it uses the very card the app had just rejected. It took days of back and forth with tech support to find out that my card ""isn't compatible with their system"", but they refused to be more specific than that and no matter how many times I asked what the exact problem was (ie my bank, the type of card, etc) all they did was rephrase the same answer over and over again with canned responses; repeatedly telling me to check w/ my bank, even after I told them I already had done so."
1,"They didn't have cars available at Bush International Airport on October 15, 2018 at 9:30 pm. Had to take a taxi. This is the second time I have experienced this, and will be my last as I will use Lyft or a taxi in the future."
0,"Don't use it, that's my recommendation!. I ordered uber, selected the car to come and pick me up , got the confirmation that Musa (driver) is coming in 14 min (price selected was 11-14EUR). Guess what 15 min later got another message that another driver is coming in 25 min.. He came after 27 min and charged me 17.5EUR +3.50EUR extra for the time....? So, he came late and i'm charged extra for this time.... I need to mention as well that i was going to hospital to change my cast, as i have a broken leg and i'm in crutches; moreover was poring rain outside.... When i got teh invoice after i'ev been charges, i sent an email, over and over again , nobody have any reply. I called them few times, and left voice messages (as nobody ever picks up the phone), no call bank nor reply until now, over 3 weeks has passed already. Don't use it, you have nobody to complain to in case the driver is rude or even offensive, and they just charge you whatever they wish, always EXTRA, never less"
0,Upfront pricing not true pricing. Uber pads the bill so much. I've had Uber drivers charge for wait time when they are parked down from my house and I am out on my front porch waiting and watching them. Booking fee $3.05 come on! Toll and surcharges plus time and distance charges. Now they are dropping me off a few blocks from my destination saying they got to take another call. Uber drivers that I have used have showed up at my house wanting a hookup. One driver started groping me on my front porch. Uber customer service is a brick wall. Credited me $3.00 on a ride on Uber Cash. No matter what they do or charge they have an excuse and they are right. When I reported the sexual harassment of the two drivers they suspended my account. They cost more than a taxi and a taxi never has told me to get out and walk the rest of the way.
0,"I don't believe there is any way to contact Uber anymore.
Even their emergency number is a recording telling you to dial 911 or review the help section in their AP.I put a very wonderful women in an Uber last night to drive her from Orange County to L.A. The driver (despite her wedding ring) put he moves on her the entire trip.
He kept harassing her for her phone number. But he didn't stop with just that. He kept touching her, rubbing his hand on her leg. She clung to her backpack praying she would get home safe.She is happily married with a child. She does not invite advancements from men in any way. She is a Pediatrician visiting L.A, to study advancements in child heart surgery so she can return to her county to help save children.She was able to send a message through the ""Uber Ap"" about the incident. She got an ""auto response"" stating that the incident will be looked into.I have searched for ""any way"" ""I"" could contact Uber (I have an account) I've tried everything. There is no way I can contact Uber.
So, Yisak - Honda Civic 8APD979 is still picking up rides. I ""hope"" the worst he does is ""groping"". Uber does not take safety seriously and I just pray no one gets hurt from this predatory driver."
0,"Drive with Uber you need to get better. I currently drive for Uber but am concerned with some drivers taking advantage of people with disabilities. I had picked up a Uber customer who had a 3 star rating, which to me I thought there was something wrong but still decided to accept the ride. When I picked up the gentleman I realized he was blind. As he got in my car we had a conversation and he told me that I was the quickest pick up he has ever gotten and asked me why. He told me he usually has to keep requesting Ubers over and over. I know why. It's because the drivers are declining a 3 star rider. I told him it was because I don't pass up any opportunities to pick people up to get them to their destination. He was the most kindest man I have ever met and I realized that other drivers have given him low ratings just because he had a disability."
0,"Uber quoted me a fare of £14. Their driver turned up late, took a very long route, got lost and then charged me nearly £35. I complained and they reduced it to £26. They will not refund the money to the £14 they quoted me.This is theft.DO NOT USE UBER THEY ARE THIEVES AND DISHONEST."
1,"Driver was fine and so was ride. Experience of dealing with getting a coupon for first ride had me looking for a human being to talk to, and was amazed to find there was no one. I think they charge enough to hire customer service of some kind. I couldn't even find a human online."
0,I called uber for going home two days ago and yesterday they charged me extra 40$ even no one told me reason. Then I contacted uber and they told me driver complained me about I was drunk or something else they sent me stupid pictures. I didn't understand exactly what happened but I just called uber and went home even I didn't talk to driver and went home. How come no one asked me anything and they just charged me 40$ directly. I will take my money back and I will delete uber.
1,"This is the email I tried to send back to uber after getting a welcome email saying how easy it was to get help (complete fabrication): the email was waiting after I got home a few days after the uber-disasterHi,Well, my attempted first trip was an absolute disaster!!1. The app did not get my current address right, and didn't want me to alter the house number. Even so, I actually wanted it to leave from a few doors down. When I finally got it to accept the new house number, it would not let me enter the suburb.2. After entering the destination, it said it would not give me a quote until AFTER I had entered credit card details. I thought this would be OK, since I'd seen estimated costs at a bit over $1 per km. But it wanted to charge me well over $900!!!!! (the trip should have been about $60, from similar trips by others). There was no obvious way to cancel, just confirm, so I closed the app thinking it would cancel .3. I re-entered the app to try the trip again. But even though I had NOT confirmed the previous attempt, it said I could not enter a trip as one was already booked for the same time.4, There was no obvious way to cancel the trip, not any way to ring or email uber to get it fixed.5. Did some searching, seems there is no way to handle emergency fixes. Utter shame on you. Many others have had similar experiences in being unable to contact anyone when something went wrong.6. Finally found a site explaining how to cancel future trips, hidden in a side menu, which I did, fortunately before the exorbitant charge was taken from my bank.Until I get over this really bad experience with your obvious complete disdain for users, and your really, really terrible app design, I will tell everybody I meet to stay away from uber, the uber-bad transport option. And intend never to use it again myself, unless something changes."

0,"Cherry picker???? Asks you where exactly you are going after he picks the order, asks if the lady is going alone, calculates if it is good money and company, then cancels the trip if it is not. You cant review him since the trip hasn't started, so he has pretty nice rate level. Happened to me, not sure how many people he has innocently questioned like that and cancelled the order."
1,Uber in the Southwestern corner of AZ has increased the prices by 11% and are keeping anywhere from 40 to 60% of the fare. Charging for a longer distance but send the driver the shortest. Lyft has con up by 6% and is still cheaper than uber.
1,"I ordered myself for a ride about 10 blocks away from my home to a restaurant knowing I would be consuming alcohol. They offered me a discounted ride to walk to the corner of my block for pickup. I agreed to that. Once I confirmed my ride, I was notified I would be dropped off about 4 blocks away from the restaurant. I never agreed to that. That part was not advertised. That area is unsafe being is next to a highway ramp with no crosswalks or traffic signals to get to my destination. So I immediately canceled the ride."
0,"Uber drivers in Honolulu, Hawaii are charging passengers extra and they have to pay them via Apple Pay or cash. Tried contacting Uber to talk about this issue. Asked for a supervisor and they gave me the runaround. I want to let people know what Uber drivers are doing. Don't know if it is just in Hawaii or other places. I had to choose one star but if it was up to me it would be -5."
1,Uber is a horrible  company  to work for.uber treats there drivers like pure trash.the customers  are always right nomatter what the uber driver says .uber is nothing but a pack of greedy wolves  who care about nothing or no one but themselves .uber has proven there fakeness .uber is a 0 0 in my opinions
1,A transportation app that has come to improve on thé day to day runing of activities all over accra or Ghana
0,I used to really like Uber and over the years only had 1 bad driver but this year I'm constantly having billing problems and having multiple extra charges above fare and tip to the point of overdrawing my bank account. Reaching customer service is a totally separate hell to go thru. I have to find an alternative because I see NO EFFORT on uber to resolve any of this.
1,"Uber one minute gave me a quote of $50 on a ride I needed. A kind family member helped me to pay for it by purchasing an Uber gift card for me. As soon as I loaded the gift card onto my account, I brought the same ride up in app--and now, not 10 minutes later, it showed $63! Just to see if this was due to surge pricing, I tried the same ride in Lyft. It was $50--the same price Uber had quoted me before I loaded the Uber gift card."
1,Worst customer service. In Uber initial fare shown only rs. 45 after ride completes it shown as rs. 90 double the charge. So I trying to customer service but all numbers not reachable. Very worst service.
1,"I completed a trip and didn't get a receipt. There's no support number and when I went to online help, it didn't understand my question, no matter how I worded it. So I guess I'm just screwed. Thanks, Uber!"
1,I have advised many people NOT to use it to save their time and money. They charged me for a service they have not offered twice and I lost about £10.00 (about £5.00 each time).I ordered a taxi and the taxi driver did not come and they still charged me. They did that again shortly afterwards.Never download this damned Uber App!! Their Refund Claim is a joke. It was very time consuming e-mailing them back and forth with a ZERO- result. They literally STOLE my money. What a shame that all this comes from a taxi company that lies about their customer service. Please listen to this golden piece of advice: NEVER use this taxi company!
1,"I was recently charged for an Uber Pass, which I did not want.  I use Uber a few times a month and it wouldn't pay to get the Pass.  When I saw the charge on my PayPal, I attempted to contact Uber, however they make it impossible to contact them.  No phone number....no email address.  Their website is horrible to navigate and doesn't even give an opportunity to speak to anyone.  I tried to dispute with PayPal and they said through Uber, they have determined that I did authorize the purchase.  Needles to say, I will be writing PayPal's review next."
0,"DONT USE UBER. USE CABIFY, EASY TAXI
GET OUT OF ARGENTINA - GO AWAY UBER - YOUR SERVICE IS NEVER NEEDED AGAIN. 
A few months ago I had a driver who was driving and talking on his cell. I had a year old baby and was stunned that he did that. I contacted Uber customer service..... they dont have customer service. I still had to pay the driver and they didnt FINE him a FEE!!! A month ago my husband, my 2 year old and I were trying to get the the hospital. My son was sick as a dog with a flu, it was raining cats and dogs so we ordered an Uber. The uber driver decided to pick us up 2 blocks away from our house. When my husband explained we had a kid sick, its raining so no please come to our location.... the driver was utterly belligerent, rude, nasty so we cancelled our trip. We got charged a cancellation fee. We have ordered drivers on a regular basis from our house to a train station and without fail almost ALL UBER DRIVERS cancel our rides so we end up waiting an extra 10 - 15 minutes for a replacement. My son has been late to school over and over again because of these Uber drivers. Uber will not give me a refund for the cancellation. I have had many friends use Uber and all have cancelled their accounts due to the lack of service, lack of morals, lack of respect."
1,"While I enjoy using Uber for traveling the convenience is nice to have.  While most of the drivers are friendly it's really only convenient in down town areas where you don't have to travel far.  I'd use them for work but it would be quite costly for a daily convenience. I work partial swing and I'm not sure who would be up at 1 am to get me home.  They only send 5 star drivers out.  I would love to dock a star to some drivers that have really filthy cars but if their car is their income source you can't.  There's really no way to leave feed back about that either.I never let an Uber driver pick us up at our house. I wait at the main drag to the complex entrance.  I've heard too many Uber drivers heading back and robbing the place.  I found Uber is really only convenient for traveling around a big city. If you are outside of the city it costs a bit more.  We have used them for trips and they were wonderful.  No communication, no worrying about tips and no chance of being dropped off at the wrong location due to the language barrier.  The app does all that for you and all you do is tap for a pick up request. Thank god for Google Maps.I prefer them over our local taxi cab drivers as most of them scare the hell out of us. Local taxi cab drives drive insanely fast, do unethical/safe maneuvers while driving, or turn the meter off (which is illegal in any state) and start shouting flat fee rates.  If this ever happens to you ask them to let you out where you are.  If they're an ass about the whole situation don't even pay them and contact their supervisor immediately to the company they are with.  This by US state law it is illegal to turn off the meter at any point a passenger is in the vehicle.  Report them to their manager after they leave. Request an uber or lyft service instead."
1,I've used Uber in various countries this year and service was good. Perhaps they should enhance their customer service.
1,"We experienced an awful organized crime (with gun shooting threats and robbing) that happened to us while riding the uber service during our visit to South Africa.
We ordered an uber from our hotel to ""catch a meeting"" in the airport at on 31st-07-2018 at 14:48hrs, 1-half way to our destination on the highway a civilian car drove beside us and asked the uber driver to pull over
2-the uber driver parked aside
3-three gunned men came out of their vehicle and approached our car 
4- Searched the glove compartment and the car trunk but they surprised that we have no luggage ""because they expected that we are leaving the country so we will have all the belongings and won't even have time to report the incident to the police because we will have a flight that we would rather catch""
5-The approached our windows and threatened to shoot us if we didn't give up all we have
6-They took 800USD and left awayHaving the above said, we consider uber solely responsible for this incident as we were under their chastity and they should have their safety and security measures and standards which shall compensate us for the risk and terrible experience we had and the money we lost but they have not done any action so far although we have reported to them the full details.
We are currently back to Dubai/UAE and we trust in your international neutral standard when it comes to life treats and peoples' safety in taking the issue up with them 
Please find attached the police reports and the uber trip details

1,"I left my phone in the car during my last ride. I have been trying to contact them through the website for 12 days with no luck. It is obvious that every response is automated, and there is absolutely no way to reach a human at the company as a rider. Uber... where are you? You have failed me. I need my belongings returned."
1,I was charged four times for one trip each of them different prices. I had to write a complaint to the bbb to in form them. Next im going after the driver since uner cant seem to be reached I will never ever take uber again and when i take lfyt ill use a dummy debit card so that only the amount i owe is taken off. Im not done going after uber though. I will be getting my money back and this is not the last place this will be posted. Ill be posting every where i can with screen shots of the money this company stole
1,Uber does not keep record of the destination address you put. The driver can put whatever destination address she/he wants and you will not get your money back if you get charged your coriders' fare. I was told they did not have a record of the the destination address I actually put.
0,"I requested a ride from Fort Worth, South Henderson Street to Irving Texas. The upfront fare they showed is 40.50 for economy ride and they said I have an offer of 25% max of 10$ per ride discount so it will be 30.50, then this driver Aashish in Toyota Corolla ** came and literally said â€œOh I was going home"" and I got a ride which is exactly close to my home that's convenient for him he said and then he took his own favorite route as per his wish and then at the end they charged me 8.96 dollars extra apart from 30.50 saying the toll charges, which means the total fare is 49-50$?? In a non busy period, that is never a fare till now. It's maximum 35-36 and or 38-39 in a busy time."
1,"Earlier, Uber was great. They used to provide prompt customer service and quick redressal of issues. Now, there is no person you can speak to, there is no acknowledgement even if you complain and random multiple charges are being deducted for the same trip. Thank God for Ola, otherwise UBER is such a scam."
0,"Uber is the worst, they charge for everything.  They allow their drivers to say that they are at the destination so that the customer is charged a waiting fee.  I was literally waiting on the driver outside for 7 minutes because he was at the wrong complex and i get charged a waiting fee.  To top it off uber allows their drivers to text and drive. I sent the pics to uber, and they stated that it is not a cause to be alarmed. I have more, but it keeps freezing when i upload more pics. Alot of the uber drivers are rude and uber doesnt care. Uber only wants your money"
1,"I have been using Uber as a rider from 2016 with a good passenger rating. Never had issues with any driver and my experience was in general good. A month ago Uber disabled my account. I reached customer support and after a few email exchanges, customer support sent me a rude (and offensive) email that I have violated the terms and conditions. I can safely say that this is truth challenged. I have no duplicate accounts, I am quiet as a rider and cooperative and never caused any issues. I asked customer support if there is a mistake and if they can lift the suspension but they ignored my request. This is no way to treat a client. Uber deals with problems because it cannot handle the vast clientele it has currently and makes mistakes, but this is no way to treat someone like this. I believe that TLC should investigate further how Uber is operating in terms of customer support, as well as monitor it much closer."
1,"Uber Eats cancel order without refund. @UberEats Hi friends. Don't order any food from Uber Eats. He will get your money and do not deliver your food, That is my experience and story. It can be with you and Its customer support will not resolve your problem. The delivery boy did not come at my home."
1,"Checking my Credit card I report, I found that UBER charged me 24.99 USD without my permission.  I bought a one-time-Ride-Pass when visiting in New-York in June 2018. I did so after getting a promotion message from the company. The fact that Ride-Pass is recurring was not mentioned. At least, I was not asked to approve a recurring monthly charge. 
Asking the company for a refund is mission impossible. There is no email address and no way you can contact them.
Also, once you were entering a payment method, there is no way to cancel it, unless you enter a new credit card. The only way will be to delete your account."
0,"We wrote this review because we wanted to let everyone know what happened to us in New Orleans and Uber did nothing about it. We went on vacation to New Orleans to take a cruise. We arrived the day before, The suggestion from our travel agent, just to make sure that nothing went wrong.We are new to Uber and our ride from the Comfort Inn Suites at the New Orleans airport to the Port of New Orleans on Feb 7 was the first time using Uber.  This was at the suggestion of the Comfort Inn Suite and we were happy with the service that was provided to the Port of New Orleans. Mileage of 14.34 and drive time of 36 minutes as recorded with a value of $21.78. On our travel from the Best Western Plus on St Charles Ave to the Louis Armstrong airport on Feb 19 was a total of 15.77 miles and a trip time of 31 minutes and with a fare charge of (adjusted by Uber from $44.11) $39.07 is still $17.29 more than our first ride with only a difference of 1.43 miles and 5 minutes. It took two weeks to get a response back from Uber. This is unprofessional.  We had explained in detail on the cost of all three of our trips with Uber, and the last trip, we where over charged, due to the driver taking a longer route. Plus the driver was on the phone with his wife when driving.  In Louisiana, law prohibits talking on your phone while driving, that is called ""Distracted Driving"" and the driver put us in harms way and insurance companies like to hear about this when it comes to distracted drivers.    We said that I will call both Hotels, and complain, we also said that I will get a hold of Uber Head Office, plus go on social media, and do a negative review, plus do a negative review on the Uber app.  My husband and I are very upset on how this has been handled, with the Uber company in New Orleans to a point that they stop returning emails, even with the Uber app.That is a very expensive 1.43 miles and 5 minute ride. The first refund proposed by Uber was $.29 we find to be a joke and totally inadequate and we were hoping that Uber would reconsider a more substantial refund.  They have refunded us so far around $10.  When checking the distance to the airport it should've been $28.00.  Since then we have not heard from Uber. Specially with the last email asking for the email for head office.So we are done with the games, will be posting this note on all social media to let everybody know be aware of Uber ripping customers off and for their safety. Plus we will also be placing this on the website of the hotels that we were staying at.This could've been prevented if they communicated with us and reimbursed us the difference which they did not I guess money is more important than having a customer base.

0,"I took Uber from IGT 1 to Sector 25 Noida and it shows rent of 820 approx. on Uber Premier, which looks good but when I reached my location without any stoppage driver asked me to pay 1210 rupees which is totally disappointing for me as prepaid taxi outside airport is even charging 950 rupees. But when I cross checked with my trip charges then I was shocked to see billing of 835 is showing on my app. I asked the driver to talk to Uber and check the same but he refused and asked to pay his charge as per his Uber application and write mail to Uber for the claim. I do took pictures of driver's mobile application screen and there is no transaction or reference number to track. Only amount, date, location is shown in it and same is with my trip detail in my Uber app. When trying to download receipt of this trip it's not opening as Uber Lite is not supporting this function. When trying to download Uber application it's not getting download."

1,I was in Montreal last week as it was raining. Wanted a quick ride to my destination so booked an Uber. The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Uber doesn't tell you the amount right away. You don't have the visibility as you do in most cabs. You can see the meter and make a quick decision of either taking the ride or stopping it right away.
1,"Launched app, was quoted $47 for the 30 mile ride home, what I expected, and what I've paid generally dozens of times. Got picked up and was later billed $133. Triple the quote. Uber says I confirmed the change. I did not, nor would I ever do so. I could have taken a limo for less than that. Dispute denied, just shut up and pay. I fired Uber, and will never use them again."
0,I placed an order on Uber Eats and the food never showed up but I was charged anyways. I called to tell the customer service reps but they ignored me. The food never showed up and now I can't eat my lunch because I gave my last money to eat today. This is completely unfair that my food never shows up and I still got charged! I want my 13 dollars back!
1,"Customer service is absolutely terrible. I have recently been locked out due to some background check. In the middle of a fair mind you. I recently relocated to a different state and have a different driver's license. The old state driver's license was still active in my account but due to it no longer being a valid license, and I supplied the new one, the background check failed and now I have to wait 7-15 days for a resolution."
0,On Thursday 27/06/19 I lost my wallet with a significant amount of cash and important identity cards and ATMs. Tried to call Uber. There are no customer helplines. Uber allows to connect to drivers but the driver had picked other rides and so that leaves me knowing that the next rider might have taken up the wallet but I can't do anything about it.
0,"Drivers take longer routes just to charge you money and they don't give you, your money back. I had the worse taxi experience with this company, driver turn all the way around and they charged me distance and long and they didn't want to give me my money back."
0,"I ordered an Uber around midnight, it said it was going to take 9 minutes so I waited, left the club with 1 min to spare, saw the car pull up, got in, only to be told the taxi wasn't for me - he hadn't even asked my name!. He said he wasn't taking me and to get out and drove away. I looked at my phone and it came up driver has cancelled. My original ride was going to cost Â£20. I tried to book another Uber and the price had been upped to Â£40-50!! I had to go home late at night on the tube with a walk at the other end which I didn't feel comfortable with."
0,"On 6/22 at 2:45PM I took an Uber. The driver (""Salaheddin"", who was a much larger man than me and could easily have removed me from his car) claimed that I was drinking in his car in the middle of the day and spilled it all over his seat. I demanded Uber refund the money and they showed me a picture of a cup with some liquid on it, and a car seat cover with some liquid on it. Probably not even his car."
1,"Uber's customer service department is absolute GARBAGE! All i needed was help changing my password because someone had hacked my account. They wanted information like my social security #, which I was not going to provide. There is no # to call them unless you pay for a premium membership - so i went to their chat support. 7 representatives came into the chat and left immediately without resolving my simple request! Or giving instructions on how to change my DA*N password! Lyfe will have my business from here forward."
0,"And where have all the good drivers gone? Maybe to Lyft?  Driver nearly an hourlate,did not rely to text or answer phone. Left my elderly mom.  She tried o contact uber safety and got a recording"
1,I was charged 60 dollars for a ride that was only 16 dollars. I was also put through hell just to get in contact with their support team who did nothing to credit my account. I was then told that it was given in UBER credit after they overdrafted my account. I am very upset that my issue has not been resolved and it happen a week ago. Bad customer support.
1,"I usually don't use Uber but I went away and had no one to take me. I had a Uber gift card but not enough money for both ways. Instead of using the balance on the gift card and charging the rest to my regular card, they did not bother to charge my gift card. They refuse to give me a refund. Customer service is the absolute worst because there is absolutely no number to call. It is by email only. This company is ridiculous and I would find another company to use."
1,"2 fraudulent trips on bank acct. Called Uber. Support only available thru app. I don't do data. Went to website. First time ever. My email was already in use. Used forgot password option 3 times. They sent LINK to reset password. I used it. Then a 4 digit code was required to complete password change. There was NO code in ANY of my emails from them. Can't sign in. Can't try to get my money back from the fraud. Bank still to investigate, but they had advised me to call Uber about it in case their investigation (claim) provided no results for me. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!"
1,"My first experience did not go well. I'm in Waikiki and needed a ride from a hotel to a restaurant for a scheduled luncheon. The app worked well and the driver was to arrive in 3 minutes. There were pick-up time adjustments as the 3 minutes passed and 15 minutes elapsed. We are now late for the luncheon when a text is received from the driver that he cancelled our ride. A new Uber request is sent and a driver dispatched with a, ""be there in 3 minutes."" No Uber after 6 minutes; however, the driver telephoned to indicate she was lost but should arrive soon. We stayed in touch by phone discussing her locations location as updates were provide. The car finally arrived and on our way to the luncheon arriving 50 minutes late. My return to the hotel from the restaurant went well."
0,"I booked an Uber ride and the driver immediately accepted the trip. The app showed me that the driver is very close to my starting point, but I could not find him anywhere. Then within seconds I received a notification saying that I am in the trip and will arrive at my destination soon. But I was still waiting at my starting point waiting for the driver to arrive. I wrote to the driving asking him where he is. No reply, and I could see him moving towards my destination."
0,"Apparently, it must be an easy way for Drivers (and Uber) in the Miami, Florida area to make a quick buck without working, as I was hit with not one, not two, not three, but SEVEN bogus charges within the span of 2 weeks. The game apparently works like this: you request a ride, the driver accepts the ride request, the driver gets near the pickup spot, cancels the request, charges your card for the cancellation (hoping you never notice the charge), then goes on to his/her next victim in the area."
1,"I have a temp medical condition that prevents me from driving, still have to do errands. Taxis in my area are unreliable & don't take cards. So I thought I'd try Uber. Downloaded their app , entered info they asked for ; scheduled a car , waited past due time , got a cancellation notice for no funds (I gave them my credit card) ; tried to re-schedule , same issue. Each time the notice gave an address 2 numbers off of mine but close so I know no car came. There is no way to contact anyone by phone or online to help resolve the issue. Never again ."
0,The two drivers in Chicago left because they did not come to the pick up area. They went to the wrong street both times. We waited for 45 minutes and they charge us $5 both times for not being there. Uber is a great concept but have horrible drivers. This is the last time I ever use Uber again.
1,"I am a senior citizen and I tried to sign up for Uber. I went to the website to create an account. I supplied my name, an email address, a cell phone # and password. Afterward, I realized I had not used the correct email address. Thus began a vicious cycle. When I tried to change the email address, it said the phone # I provided was already in use. It kept asking me to send a screenshot of my phone. I have no idea how or what that entails. I could not find a phone # or customer service agent. There was nowhere to go to complete the transaction. I ended up going to GogoGrandparent through Lyft, but I would prefer Uber."
0,"I called for a ride. A woman jumped in the car and they drove off despite me showing him that it was me who called. I was then charged for the ride. I complained and the fare was refunded. I was also charged a flat fee of $6.95, which they refuse to refund. Why would I be charged when it was the driver's error?! They have ignored my emails of course. I will NEVER use Uber again! I'll stick with cabs or Lyft."
0,"I was transported by Uber a few times by the VA. Sometimes they were on time, sometimes not. I only had one bad experience with them, and was a rude driver. He didn't seem to want to take me at all. I'm sure the VA paid good money to transport me, but he was just real unfriendly."
1,"I have asked several times from the tech support team   "" where would I go to print up ALL
my receipts with Uber......Uber wants to charge me $1.00 join a service for that fee
THAT IS RIDICULOUS AND CHEAP OF THEM
THUMBS DOWN UBER   ZERO RATING FOR YOU"
0,"At late night hour Uber driver after accepting my trip drops me midway in a deserted parking and threatened me as my trip was booked on online payment and he wanted cash. The follow ups with Uber and their responses have been appalling. On asking for driver contact details for registering a Police complaint they are denying it on account of privacy issue and sharing the car's name plate, an Information that I am sharing in my every conversation and complaint. As a company #Uber is more concerned about protecting the interests of their Driver Partner but not keen in safeguarding the safety of their Customer."
0,"I used Uber for the first time, I ordered a taxi and I received messages saying a taxi was on its way only for them then to cancel it, this happened twice in the space of 20 minutes or so. It was around  2am on and I was on a dark road waiting. Then I received another message saying a taxi was on its way and would be there in 8 minutes. A good twenty minutes later it still hadn't arrived. I rang the  driver and he said he was on his way. After another ten minutes he rang me to say he had arrived! He had not! I explained where I was only for him to then hang up on me! To make matters worse Uber  then messaged me to say they had taken £4.00 off my card because I had cancelled the  ride! I then had to walk three miles home. I cannot get any response from Uber. Stay away from the scamming b stards."
0,"I requested an Uber as I usually do and the trip went very good. As soon as I reached my destination, a friend opened the door for me to help me with my Bags. I always look back to see if I forget anything, and I didn't, and my friend didn't see anything wrong with the seats as well. The next day I received an email stating that they are charging me for a cleaning fee of 80 Dollars. There was nothing wrong with the backseats. I tried contacting Uber support but it was worthless. Nobody answers via text and they don't have any customer service number. After this horrible experience I don't trust this company anymore. I will no longer be using uber services for their lack of professionalism, and the accountability of your lousy driver."
0,"I usually have good experiences with Uber but this one driver charged us for a cleaning fee, his vehicle was already a mess to begin with. Not sure why Uber doesn't do anything to protect consumers about these kinds of charges. We didn't bring anything with us or did we have any food or any accidents in the vehicle."
0,"My husband and I just got back from a walk home after never being picked up by our Uber driver. She ignored our calls and shortly after canceled our ride and we got charged. This is not the first time this has happened to us since moving to Orlando. We have been putting two and two together with the Orlando area and Uber drivers. We have discovered that people put in for rides, rides show up close by but never pick you up and then either, you cancel or they cancel, either way you get charged! What?! This is crazy, we have used Uber for years and this is unexceptionable. We will not waste our money on a company that doesn't regulate their employees to pick up people or have any record of them ignoring calls. I guess it's time to try a new company like Lyft. Change needs to happen in Orlando, I am not the only one with concerns."
0,An Uber driver was parked in a van with his door open waiting for a customer to come out. My son asked this driver to call 911 because there was a girl running around trying to stab him and his friends. This driver refused to call 911. Then this girl and a guy with a hoody on came up to my son and the guy stabbed my son in the neck and ran off. This Uber driver was still sitting there when this occurred. My son was on the ground holding his neck and blood was rushing out and he again asked your driver to please call 911. This Uber driver once again refused.
1,"Feedback about the booking fee. Recently Uber started to charge a so-called booking fee, claiming that this is to support one of a sudden safety initiatives. What am I getting from your safety initiatives? Just another trick to charge customers more. Would love to see the list of Uber initiates they currently do for passengers. Also, there is no transparency about the fee. It should be added to the estimated cost of a trip before a customer orders rather than in a sneaky way of adding after the fact. Just very frustrating because such a reputable company like Uber make its customer feel like fools."
1,"Uber steals what little drivers make and puts the money in their fat pockets. Doesn't even come close to making minimum wage. Uber is too busy stealing from drivers while reducing their pairing. They control your earnings and steal 40% waste of time, money and gas. You'll drive around more looking for trips than you would actually driving passenger. If you complain Uber retaliates. Uber has made numerous changes to drivers earnings while they collect all the profit including the pools that should count multiple passengers towards your quest. Instead only counts as one trip. You make less than minimum wage and isn't even worth carpooling to work. Drivers are going on strike for a reason because Uber steals from them. Waiting two hours for a passenger nothing. It's not even worth it carpooling to work."
1,"Uber has been nothing but a headache since I started working for them. I take a 1 hour drive and they take the money away from me saying that I picked up the wrong person from a specific household to a business. Please tell me what the likelihood of me picking up someone from a house and go in one hour away to a business and we picking up the wrong person is.... Oh you say it makes no damn sense, yeah you're right. Smfh. Uber takes no time whatsoever to do any sort of investigation not even an email to find out anything at all from the driver. They just send an email saying that they took your money and you wasted your time. This is not the only nonsense that I have had to deal with. A customer broke the handle of my car and there was a huge run around with handling that. I will no longer be driving with this unprofessional company and I will be taking legal action."
1,"My friend referred me to open an Uber account, and I received a C$10 promotional discount. I took Uber from Pearson Airport T1 to Dufferin and Steeles area on May 19. The upfront price was C$30.78, the final price was C$37.66, and I took screenshots of both. I wrote to Uber and attached the two screenshot pictures. I was advised by Uber that there is a C$2.75 for booking Fee, and C$4.50 for Airport Surcharge, and Uber replied as follow: ""The estimated amount of the toll or surcharge is included in your upfront price before taking a trip. On this trip, your actual route included roads with tolls or surcharges that were not accounted for in your predicted route and your upfront price was adjusted."""
1,"If I could rate this experience any lower, I would. This was my first and last trip with Uber. My credit card was charged $33.60 for the trip to my destination, and $113.62 for the return trip. I contacted Uber and they would not refund the overcharge. This is certainly no way to run a business and no way to treat their customers. Terrible experience. Next time I will call a cab. Attached are photos of my receipts."
0,Scheduled a ride to the Tampa Airport. Driver never showed up with no notice. Tried to book a ride again but web site couldn't or wouldn't supply a ride. Ended up having to book a regular taxi. Won't count on Uber again!
1,I use Uber when I miss the bus after work sometimes. The last two times it says a reasonable price usually about 8-10 dollars. Then after booking the ride and confirming the flash new price which has been 13-14 dollars. Then it asks if I want to pay 25 dollars to get to pay 9.99 for the ride instead of the 13-14 dollar price. This has happened 3 times now. I'm sorry but I'm not gonna pay 25 bucks so that I can pay another 10 for the ride home. That's ridiculous.
0,"Overall a very marvellous travelling facility, with uptodate vehicles and decent partners. Really helping a lot of people on daily basis by saving them from headache of wandering in the streets for taxis and bargaining with the illiterate drivers. thumbs up"
0,I ordered and had to reorder my food again and pay for all food that's were not delivered to me... The delivery guy did not make a real attempt to reach me or ring my bell. And Uber customer service is very bad. No one to talk to!
1,"My wife and daughter spent a couple of days in Belfast. They decided to use Uber on the 1st day. Hotel Etap to Primark, journey is roughly 1 mile and had the cheek to charge them Â£14. This is someone taking advantage of 2 women on a break. It took them 10 minutes to walk back to the hotel. Didn't even want to leave the 1 star but you can't give them zero. This behaviour is disgusting."
0,"We called a Uber, she went to wrong location and Uber making us pay for this trip because of their own Uber driver. We canceled after she never responded to my calls! We then got another driver... Crazy. I am done!!"
0,"I used to be so happy with Uber until I got a ** driver who decided to scam me by taking a massive detour for some extra bucks even though he was aware at what time my flight was leaving. I was in the car with my baby girl in the car seat trapped on this traffic jammed highway asking him to please stay on route because I needed to catch my plane. Him giving me one ** story after another and keeps driving . By massive detour I mean a ride that usually even with heavy traffic takes an hour max. With his scheme it took me 2,5 hours."
0,"All the cabs provided by Uber in India are extremely dirty and have a horrible stench settled in them which mostly comes from the drivers. The mats are literally matted with cakes of dirt and the seat covers are almost always stained. To top it all the drivers are really unprofessional, they refuse to come up on the pickup point and if they don't feel like executing the ride, the driver ends up calling the rider and asks them to cancel the ride. Hence lowering the rating of the rider. I have had extremely bad experience with Uber at multiple times. I have been dropped in the middle of the road by the drivers just because they didn't have an internet connection to check the maps. The drivers are racist as well sexist and on many an occasion have passed very rude and vulgar remarks."
1,It's absolutely horrible experience and felt systematic loot by the corporate whose tariff not controlled by any government authorities. Neither they care for our laws. The charge for Goregaon west to CST RAILWAYS WAS Approx 1000/- INR WHEN I GOT DOWN within 2 km they charged me 230/- as penalty. Is our government protecting our right and controlling unethical business practices of UBER? Disgusting.
1,I have been charged several time for wait time fees. These are fraudulent charges. The 2 charges Uber refunded and now I have another one and they will not refund. How do we get to stop charging fraudulently for a service not received?
1,After continuously reminding that i was charged more by the driver i have not yet got refund nor yet any customer executive is assigned to this matter. It's been four days. I have not received any mail regarding it. It's really difficult to contact Uber as there is no direct call center for customers complaints. We just have to write on Uber help or support but dont get any response from them. I know writing here also will not sort my issue but it's just ridiculous.
1,"I was quoted $12 for a 2.8-mile ride that took 11 min and was charged 27.63 on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm. This was their charges: Base Fare $2.10, Time $4.56, Distance $3.30, Normal Fare $9.96, 2nd person $9.96, Waiting Time $ .86, Booking Fee $1.85, Tip $5.00. In what universe? Crooks. Criminals."
0,"I ordered our meal on Mother's Day. Finally I get an update that security would not let the driver in. I texted, ""Where are you?"" He stated my job. I've explained 3 times that is not the place I entered and asked when he would be at my address 5 miles away. The driver cancelled my order and refused a refund. I contacted Door Dash for the same restaurant and they saved the day. DO NOT USE UBER EATS!"
1,"Months ago, I purchased & loaded an Uber gift card on my Uber app. It then refused to accept the gift card DEMANDING additional credit or debit card... Hi-jacking & holding the money I spent & entered on the app of their official gift card. Months later, I entered a debit card issued by MetaBank in Iowa & it refused to accept it!!! Now, after nearly 2 hours of trying to access my account data, it won't accept my password. After over an hour of trying to reset my password and receiving numerous reset codes from Uber, they still won't allow me access the account! What they're doing is personal data collection of phone number, debit & credit cards, email address & social media accounts. Who's paying them to collect personal data! Sneaky way of personal data collection & robbery at the same time."
1,"Rates can be astronomical. Cancellation rates are high. Customer service support, is unhelpful, and most members are hard to understand. Supervisors are not available. Time waiting on hold is beyond substandard. Any issues take 24-48 hours to be resolved, or aren't resolved at all. Money is essentially stolen from passengers, and drivers. Any/all interactions with the company are frustrating, and negative."
1,"I use Uber service at least 20 times a month, I was charged for an additional stop that I did not take, when I contacted the help website they were less than helpful. I received a response â€œthe driver's additional stop was justifiedâ€, and I in turn was charged the additional amount. So, I asked 3 times for a refund for the money that I added to my account for future trips that I would be taking, and I never received a response. As a matter of fact the Help Desk kept pinging me without a response. This is not the first time that this has happened, but it's the first time that my money was not refunded; it's the same address every time that Uber adds to my trip."
1,"Uber Events no show. Let me start by saying I LOVE Uber. But Uber event didn't work, my guest were unable to use the ride I offered. Also I have no way of contacting Uber to get answers. I have searched online with no luck - support shouldn't be this hard!"
1,Uber put my account on a 48 hour hold because I added new info to my account. Uber has not yet paid me my money. Feels like they are trying to hold on to it and not give it to me. Uber does not care about their drivers at all. Uber always feels the customer is right which is not the truth at all. Uber needs to get it together something serious.
1,"Uber is the worst company I have ever dealt with - ever. They constantly try to nickel and dime you with their sneaky fees and incompetent drivers are the worst in the business. They shouldn't be allowed to charge you whatever they want and when you dispute it they do nothing but tell you, ""Hey you have a lot of disputes"" - well hello maybe it's because you guys suck? I deleted my account and will never use them again."
0,"My mother had a ride on 7th May through Uber App and she left her mobile in the cab. After that we are continuously trying to connect with the driver Satendra, who didn't responded to our calls and he immediately switched off the phone... We had immediately reported this incidence to Uber and after their responses, I personally feel like Uber himself trained them for all cheat happen with their customers, everytime just their automated responses were coming no one bother to understand the pain of Senior Citizen Female traveller, moreover, I have wrote an email to uber CEO, and found he is too least bother about customers and their issues. I won't anyone suggest to opt Uber henceforth, they are not reliable."
1,Just not good. Try to book a ride to the airport and the app say something about invalid payment method with American Express. So bad trying to resolve the issue and still not being resolve. Better get taxi cap.
0,"Uber have drivers going to areas needing a lot of rides, offering promotion and not paying!!! When you call to inform them they make up rules other than the initial ones. I have been cheated twice!!! They don't provide a way to legitimately complain, putting people on the phone that you can barely understand. They do not care about their drivers!!!!"
1,Don't use Uber. If you need a ride use Lyft. Uber has left me stuck in the middle of nowhere. I put $25 on my account and I can't even use it. They locked my account for no reason at all. I can't even get my money back. I try to email them and I get the same response over and over again. I will never use this crap anymore. Uber sucks.
1,"After comparing Uber and Lyft prices for about a $40 ride, I choose Uber although the price was slightly higher just as a preference. Few mins after the ride was complete, I received an email with adjusted fair, which was $10 more than the upfront price. When contacted Uber, they gave all kind of excuses to not refund the upcharge by claiming a route change etc. Driver (a human) missed one turn and took the next one which probably change the total by 0.8 mile. Not my fault or indeed anyone's, as this is a common occurrence."
1,"Last night I took Uber to go from SNA to San Clemente. The fare estimate included taking a route that required tolls. However the actual ride did NOT take the toll road. This is the second time I was charged for a toll that was not used. In addition, there was a 3 cent wait charge. 3 cents is not the issue, there was no wait time involved. I waited for the car to arrive at the pick up location, traffic was non-existent all the way to SC. Does UBER arbitrarily charge things!!!! When the first ride had the toll charge, I sent an email to UBER because calling them and getting them to answer is next to impossible. Anyone else have a similar experience? JO"
1,"Today evening around 8:50 pm, going from East coast Rd Intercontinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort in Chennai to EPA PACIFIC CITY APARTMENT which is 11KMs, I took Uber. Pathetic experience and worst thing I did. Driver was so damn rude and ill mannered and as the fare should have been maximum 150-200, somewhere between which is the unusual fare for this trip on. I paid RS 630+toll tax of 37 and driver telling me I owe RS 630 which was showing for my last trip from Intercontinental Resort to Airport which I didn't took! I couldn't understand WHY I was being falsely accused of having outstanding balance, nor WHY the fare should have been so much. Just 11kms. Quoted rupees more than the fare I already paid!"
1,"Uber charged me about a total of 30 dollars because their drivers could not find the Uber pick up lot  at the ft lauderdale airport.  one driver made it there and did not speak English.Two others went to departure lanes.  i complained and got back 6,00. several people have told me they have the same problems with Uber."
1,"I have changed my phone number back in December 2018 but didn't try to change my phone number on my Uber app until recently. While I was able to change it on the app, I can't update the payment information. I reached out to customer service and they asked me bunch of questions like sending them screenshot of my phone number, name on the account, last ride taken, etc."
0,I received half coke all spilled and fries were all sad and Mc Oreo flurry was open all melted.. I send feedback immediately on app.. Send pic of coke too.. And they only refunded for Oreo flurry.. Rest all food was wasted.. BUT NIRAJ ** said that madam apne Sirf Oreo k bare me Likha.. But he dint understand English review about entire order was waste.. And was arguing with me on call... Highly not recommended... Zomato and Swiggy is far better... At least Customer service is literate there.
1,"How is it possible for Uber to auto sign me up for a 14.99 pass to ride once a month without any proof and my signing or clicking anywhere. I have tried to call the thieving company, have tried leaving bad reviews and hoping to get an email or a call. There are no phone numbers to get them or emails anywhere. I am now calling up my bank to return the charge and have disabled my app and will never never never use them again. What a crock or horse poop! Show my one strand of proof I signed up for this and how dare you charge me without me being able to call you."
1,"The last two times I have taken an Uber from my work to my home in the suburbs they have added $2.86 SURCHARGE. The surcharge says for tolls/parking/etc so I didn't figure it would apply to me. My work is in a suburb. I used Uber twice in two days, first time at 11:30am and second time at 930pm. NO SPORTS around, NO CONCERTS around, NOTHING around. They added $2.86 SURCHARGE. So when I wrote them they said prime time/weather/sporting events/etc could be the reason??!! WRONG! Nothing near me except 15 Uber cars spinning around waiting. This is fraud if they do not have to tell you WHAT the surcharge is for?? They can't tell me why I have paid it for both of my rides. They just keep saying due to ""high volume"". So I asked when is NOT HIGH VOLUME?? They said they do not know. FRAUD. Please investigate them. Thx!"
1,"I suppose my 1st; emotional review was rejected by this site because it was anonymous. Too bad because people say all truths with 1st story. So because they decided to support Uber and not post my real-life experiences, hear it a filtered narrative. I work for Uber but before I worked for Uber I was a passenger. Uber - Passenger: Uber is pre-installed on ALL androids because some politician was paid and lobbyist got this approved. This is probably why this company gets away with so much **. Uber is a technology and is run from Philippines or India with some fake headquarters in California. I called the California attorney general to issue complaints â€“ THAT HOW I FOUND OUT."
1,"Uber's customer service is beyond horrible. It's been three weeks and I still can't get them to reset my account. Someone answers after three emails maybe. Then they ask the same questions. And then never respond again. If you have an issue, don't expect it to ever be solved. This isn't my first encounter. My previous company stopped working with them as a business client because they never responded to any of our emails."
0,"I booked a ride for 7:30 AM and the driver shows up at 7:05 and calls me to come down. I politely said I would be there in about 10 minutes and that I had booked my ride for 7:30. The driver hang up and didn't say anything until the end of the trip when I arrived at the airport, only to find that I was charged a considerable (almost 15% of the whole bill) fee for ""waiting time."" How is this ok when the trip actually started earlier than scheduled, which was entirely at the driver's will? Now that I did some research, it seems that in 2017 Uber added tons of hidden fees that are controlled 100% by drivers so they had many more ways to get paid more, of course by the consumer who knows nothing all so that Uber didn't have to spend a cent more on their contractor drivers. Utterly a scam."
1,"Uber's human customer service for riders is deliberately non-existent. The only service offered is via the app. There is no way to send email to Uber describing a problem. There is no way to send feedback to Uber except via the app, and then only tightly restricted responses are possible. I somewhat get it. There are countless millions of Uber riders, and Uber does not want to spend money reviewing random complaints. But I have found no way to provided feedback for a very serious problem."
1,"I have been a customer for several years, recently purchased a new phone and no longer remembered my password and switched jobs so didn't have access/the email connected to the account no longer existed. Despite proving my identity over 10+ emails and several days and providing a new contact email, Uber has yet to reset my account. In fact, the first several emails simply copied and pasted the website's recommendation. I have deleted their app and plan on using Lyft in the future. What kind of company can't help a customer use its platform? Ridiculous."
1,"Customer supports are the most incompetent people I've ever interacted with in my life. After the 8th interaction, I get a new person every time. They clearly don't spend any time reading past interactions, mention surface issues, and close the case. It's ridiculous. Account payment not working for 1 month. Changed cards, reinstalled, deleted cache => nothing works."
1,"I've never had a problem with Uber until last night. I scheduled a ride last night and it cost $12.00. When I called for a pickup they told me it would be a while and that the price went from $12.00 to $40.00 because they were busy, what B.S. So I wheeled my friend and her wheelchair at night in the dark at 12 midnight through a bad area because no one was available to pick me up and I only had enough money for the original price of $12.00. Being a female with a disabled person in a wheelchair was a very dangerous situation. I really think Uber stinks because of this."
1,Ordered a meal that never arrived. Uber Eats took the money from my account. After contacting Uber Eats they said they would refund the money to my account. The money was never refunded. Do not trust this company!!!!
0,"Uber is ""generally"" quick, reliable, and safe. Only had 1 driver with strong smell of marijuana in the car- put me on guard of being pulled over by police. Otherwise, drivers I've encounter were courteous and cognizant of their safety as well as mine by introducing themselves and calling me by name. I always check the license plate before entering the automobile."
1,Firstly Uber uses an outsourced call center to receive and take calls for their company. The employee I spoke to was a supervisor by the name of JOHN who was in the Philippines. He did not care about my concerns about my safety. They are unconsidered with their employee's SAFETY. The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that's did not feel or look safe. Ubers only consider is making sure you get the rider to their destination and not how to protect its drivers from harm while driving. This company should really evaluate the safety for not only their riders but their Drivers as well.
1,Uber Support for Drivers is a disaster. They tell you to do the same thing over and over and keep giving you negative results. They also change their story constantly. No wonder they are unprofitable. I pity the fool who invests in this company. Incompetence is an art form at the support center. A bunch of malfunctioning robots.
0,"After a long trip we took Uber from our airport to home. It was my fault that in gathering our things I left one small bag in the back seat. I have been trying to contact the driver/Uber since then. My first attempt to contact the driver was successful in reaching him BUT he promised to bring the bag over but hasn't shown up yet (48 hours). I have tried contacting him again through the Uber App, which is the only way I know to get in touch with him. No return calls yet. I then went back to the app and followed the ""can't contact the driver"" link and have reached out to Uber to become involved -- twice. No response from Uber. This is NOT what I think of when I think of customer service. The bag contains critical things like me heart/BP Medication and my passport!"
1,"I ordered an Uber. Price estimate was between 27-35$. I ordered Uber, and they charged me 73.00$. More than double the price estimate. There was no traffic. I took that route multiple times, at different times of the day and the maximum charge for the trip was 38-40$. Now 73.00$. I wrote to them numerous times, but they gave me silly explanation and never refunded my money. Definitely they should not charge me more than 35$. They have your credit cards, and they think they can charge whatever they feel like it. Someone has to look at what Uber is doing."
1,Uber is allowing credit theft from companies like PayPal! Was hacked for 300 dollars in Uber charges that I didn't make! Shut them down for not able to verify payment from fraud! Do not use your app for paying through Uber!
1,"I signed up for a ride and UBER sent the driver to the destination not the pick up point. So the driver came all the way back to get me as he said it was UBER'S fault and that this happens every once in a while. Then they charged me for all the time the driver spent both ways, I sent in a complaint and they told me basically, ""Too bad sorry we can not credit you."" They charged me nearly 3 times what the original quote was. Thanks for reading this."
0,I have been driving for Uber for 10 months and today I found out they are not reimbursing the drivers in Hampton Roads Virginia the correct amount for the tolls. I spoke to a few reps who informed me they will only correct the past 10 days. SHAME on Uber for not taking care of their drivers and doing the right thing.
1,"My Uber account was hacked and someone swiped $475 from my bank account. They used the Uber cash for UberEats and some rides. I contacted Uber and they agreed that since my bank card had been canceled that they would give me Uber cash credit, which I agreed to because I knew I would eventually use it. They only refunded me $225 and ignored my repeated attempts to explain that that wasn't the complete refund. After days of trying to resolve the issue, they closed my account entirely. Their ""cut"" and ""paste"" responses make no sense and now they're ignoring me entirely."
1,"I had both Lyft and Uber apps and when I needed to go somewhere, I would compare the prices on both. In doing this comparison one day, I saw that Uber was a lot cheaper that day (which almost never happens) by about $2 something. I jumped at it and booked my ride with Uber and was taken to my destination. I paid and thought that was it. THE NEXT DAY (I swear), Uber charged me an ADDITIONAL $2 something (just about identical to what the difference in prices between Uber and Lyft were for that distance)."
1,This past week I used the Uber service twice to attend a meeting at my job. Both rides from my house to the office and vice versa were two different prices than what I was initially shown before submitting the ride request. When I contacted Uber via email they stated that the prices I showed them from my bank statements weren't showing on their system. The only price they can see is the initial upfront price before I submitted the request for the ride. This is a fraudulent company and I don't recommend anybody using their services. Uber is a bunch of thieves and I believe no one is actually at the receiving end of the emails but yet just a bunch of automatic messages. Never will I be using Uber again. This company needs to be shut down.
0,"Most of the drivers are unprofessional. Even in summers the A/C won't be switched on and when asked, they re-confirm if we really want A/C! The most frustrating cases are where they accept the ride, don't turn up to the location, don't call, don't pick up our calls and then choose to cancel it putting the cancellation charges on us. Other transportation options are in fact becoming better where Uber is just getting worse day by day."
1,"In my most recent requests for an Uber Ride here in April 2018, I was quoted a price on the app, and the final charge to my card was nearly twice the amount. I was completely shocked, felt deceived, and was completely blindsided. Their advertisement stating that you will know your price before requesting your ride is not true and misleading. Additionally, I was charged a â€œwait feeâ€ on these requests. How can I be charged a wait fee when I was standing at the curb when the driver pulled up? I will no longer use Uber for a ride, and will give my business to Lyft."
1,Great idea of sharing your rides. But it is turning to taxi service which is not good. Usually good service. Convenient application. Inexpensive. Unfortunately price is going up. Can't wait when self driving cars witbe available. Robotaxi!!!
1,"04-12-2018  Warning! do not do any type of buisness with uber!! they have become pure evil!   they no longer have customer service support. You can not reach anyone by phone and they email support team is paid by how may tickets they answer not how many problems they solve. so you get uncaring people playing games and giving you fake responses that do not help you over and over again. I have pleaded with these people and told them they placed the wrong account to my phone number and email so therefore I can not log on to see my pay tax forms or drive,  they keep sending a short response telling me to check my app?? sooo I am done they messed up my account and have been giving my false help for over a week......so please beware beause if something should happen and you need them....you get people in another country playing games with your life!!  BEWARE UBER IS EVIL"
1,The most advertised company Uber Eats has worst application and the order procedure where they don't let the customer to cancel the order but reflects on guidelines to ask on support where the customer support also keeps on wasting time of the customer during the procedure so that they can charge the price of order and then cancel it. Happened twice. Customer executive name: Saurabh.
1,"I purchased $50.00 (paid 48.00 per their promotion) of Uber credits, i.e., Uber Cash on 2/15/19. I could not use this Uber Cash until March. My recent rides since then total $34.00, meaning I should have a balance of $16.00. But my account has a balance of only $6.00; $10.00 has gone to places unknown. There is no phone number to call on this, and the website is useless. I strongly DO NOT recommend using Uber Cash. Your money goes into a black hole."
1,The cancellation fee should change because if a driver is 20-30 minutes away I would like to cancel because I need someone closer and you can't see how far away the driver is until you confirm the price and that's when you see how far away the driver is to meet with and you. And in most times the cancellation fee is taken out even if you don't meet with the driver and you cancel the fee is taking out the app show $0.00. And when you check your debit card account it show that it has been taken out so sometime needs to be done or changes to the app and service!!
1,"I ordered $50 dollars worth of food, the delivery was 5 minutes away, but the driver drove past my house to deliver someone else's food so it took 20 minutes after pickup for delivery. The food was not edible so I tried to cancel the order. I tried to return the food, but neither the burger place or Uber would refund or return the untouched slop they delivered to me. They have horrible customer service and mislead their customers by not advertising ""all sales are final,"" they should be closed down for fraudulent practices."
1,I just got charged an extra $20 for a trip that allegedly took 20 min than it actually did. I was dropped off 20 min earlier than shown in the receipt. Uber's receipt is based on false information that Uber has profited from. Disgraceful!
1,"Have a problem with Uber gift card and it's been 2 months as of April 2018. After being bounced around from different Uber helpers via email since you can't call into uber, the problem is still not fixed with my gift card. Every response is an automate response because they never read the full compliant. Finally got move to a manager and the response was also automated. Was told they can't do anything if you gift card got stolen, when I never mention it being stolen. I have to card but then it's not working, so uber robbed me of $200.00 now!"
0,"The drivers, of course drive extremely fast. To get to no-where, then they will scam you by adding extra charges to your ride. Some will even put you out. The also have some drivers with filthy and nasty vehicles. They will hire anybody."
1,"I ordered UberPool, with 30% discount, the ride price was $5. Uber asked me if I want to walk and pay cheaper. I didn't want to walk and price got $9. I canceled and tried again, and again, from $5 (with discount) price got $9. I was trying to contact Uber - no way. I took taxi. Now I'm trying to reach Uber to get to know what to expect and why price got up - Uber has no customer service and no way to contact Uber."
0,"We're driving on White School Rd Sevierville 2:30, 4/8/19. Driver whipped around us splashing puddles of water everywhere. He was speeding. It was raining, and it was downright scary. A School bus was en route and this road has many curves. The UBER driver was unsafe and a danger to us, school children and everyone else on the road. I found it disturbing that nobody from UBER can be reached by phone, text or email. I think there is enough detail in my review. People need to be able to CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. I tried and got redirected to everything but the tooth fairy... TRY CALLING UBER TO REPORT A COMPLAINT FOLKS... Let me know what website you're redirected to."
1,"I have a FreedomPop number which Uber's system sees as a VOIP. Despite sending an email with a picture of FreedomPop's app showing otherwise and a link showing that my phone does not have a phone number in settings as the way FreedomPop works is weird they keep responding with the same message ""It looks like a VOIP"" and ""send a screenshot of the settings"" which my phone does not have."
0,the drivers around nyc are awesome !! the service of the app is very decent but still its not the perfect app out there...
1,"Wish I could give less than a one star review.
It is so hard to deal with this company.  No one to talk to so as to confirm that the reservation.  The most difficult company to deal with for a ride.  
I will never call them again.Joe"
1,"I recently had a missing payment on 3/11/19. I contacted Uber and was told to submit a bank statement with deposits before this date and after this date. I got the paperwork from my bank and submitted it to Uber. Uber claims that there was a technical issue and the payment was pending. According to Uber, the payment was deposited into my account successfully. The only problem is that my bank says otherwise."
1,I have been a loyal customers for a few years. I take several Ubers a day spending roughly almost $ a month. I have two jobs and mistakenly put the address of the wrong job. 2 minutes into the ride I realized I was going to the wrong location. Instead of going right he went left. I told him to let me out (okay with being charged being that it was my mistake) but when I told him to stop he rode faster to the destination making it completely unsafe and dangerous being that it was also raining this morning. He left me at my destination leaving me all the way on the other side making the fare that much higher. I had to pay an additional $15 to the $7.63 I had to pay for the last one.
1,"I downloaded the app in Charleston and didn't even get to use it before it locked me out and wouldn't let me use either mobile number to create another account. Absolutely rubbish, terrible customer service. I couldn't even delete my account as it wouldn't let me. They kept referring me to emails the support team had sent but I never received them. Totally disgraceful company."
0,Your diver was not professional. He came very late for pick up. He took 15 minutes for 3 kilometers and he is not ready to understand my problem. I face very bad experience. Early morning empty roads of Chandigarh he took 15 minutes. OMG. 6:30am I did my booking. 6:45 he came to pick me up. It is hardly 2 minutes distance. From driver location to my pick point location. It was madness that I trust on your company and your professional drivers.
1,I used Uber in 3 countries recently and service was totally good. They should work a bit their customer relationship
1,"Arrived at port Columbus Ohio few days ago and did not have a ride. For the first time, I downloaded Uber app. to get a short ride home. Prior to my arrival, I was in Chicago and checked their fair prices and it seemed inexpensive.  Once I arrived in Columbus, I requested a ride which was higher by $9.25 So I thought maybe it was after hours and that would be ok. The driver arrived early and would not wait for me to get out of the airport so he took off because I was not outside immediately. I was not happy so I got on the Uber app again and requested a new ride. This time the fair was twice the original amount. I was totally upset. But who can I call. The drive informed me that they only pay him $1 per mile regardless of how much Uber charges the customers. I felt sorry for him and told him that I personally would not use Uber again."
1,I scheduled an Uber pick up for 3 am in north Scottsdale Az for a 5:15 am plane. Uber did nothing to assure there would be a driver available at that hour. Uber simply began searching for a driver at 3 am. As a result I was forced to wake my son to take me to the airport. This is not a scheduled car service. It is unreliable. I will make other arrangements in the future. Thedaler
1,"First off, the drivers are amazing. For one company to have so many positive and professional employees is amazing. However, I am certain that their awesomeness is not a result of the trickle down effect. I know this because, when it comes to Uber's corporate staff, customer service does not exist; literally! Their one flaw that I've observed in every driver is directly the daily of Uber executives. That flaw is poor GPS technology. Nearly every GPS app (including Waze and Lyft) is superior to Uber. This is a problem that would have been solved if the company had a customer service strategy and department worth mentioning."
0,"Took an Uber pool. The driver barely spoke English, but me stuck in traffic, told me it would be another 40 minutes to get to my destination, told me (in his limited English) that I could get out immediately and was charged $45 instead of $10. Got nowhere with customer support. Will pursue all my options to make sure nobody else has this experience."
0,"Someone from Brooklyn, NY driving a KIA hacked my Uber Driver account in the Fall of 2018, earned about $2,000 posing as me. Just be aware that there are Uber drivers picking up women and at times, children, who could not be approved for their own account for things like failing a background check for criminal activity, DUIs and drug convictions. Uber has weak cyber protection on their accounts and I am proof of this. Shame on you Uber."
0,"On Saturday February 9, 2018 I was at the Costco wholesale store at the waterfront and I requested an Uber driver to return to my apartment. The Uber app said that the driver name was Asiha and the car was supposed to be a Red Dodge Avenger. Since the Driver arrived everything turned to be problems, first of all she arrived in a car that was not the one listed in the app, she arrived in a Grey Chevrolet Malibu, then she get lost trying to get out of the waterfront and she said that the GPS was crazy and she does not know how to get out there. My roommate and I had to told her how to get out there, then when we finally get on route to my apartment the GPS started working and she took a different route that was not the one that the Uber app was telling her to take. Once again, she got lost and in order to get back in track, she made a horrible U turn putting our life in danger. 
      I´m very concern about this situation because the information that the app tells the customers about the drivers has to match exactly with the driver's description and also with the description of the car. The information given in the app does not match with the description of the car and this can be a very bad issue if we had any kind of accident during the trip. I encourage you to review this information to prevent anything bad to happen in the future and also to review the driver information to make sure everything is in order."
1,I feel like Uber should be better about not taking advantage of riders. I recently took a ride from my home to the airport. I left my home at 4:30 on a Tuesday morning and paid a reasonable charge of $26.00. When I returned a week later Uber felt like they had me by â€œthe Ballsâ€ and wanted $76.00 for the same route return. The ride there was Uber X. The ride back was economy. I call it getting taken advantage of. Get Lyft for a return option. I paid $21.00 instead of $76.00!! Talk about getting taken advantage of. ** Uber!
0,"On January 10th I ordered an Uber, Driver requested cash payment, I immediately left the car and contacted Uber support. 3 months later on March 24th, Uber charges me a cancellation fee for this trip. I cannot dispute the charge because 30 days past the incident they are not able to make changes. Does this mean, when Uber drivers request Cash payment, we better accept it, otherwise Uber is going to charge you the cancellation fee?"
1,"Evidently, the ride-pass that I purchased expired after a month(?); the purported discount was never applied to my account, & it automatically renewed making Uber the most expensive ride option for me. For the consumer, Uber has erected obstacles to obtaining assistance. I will dispute the charges and delete the app."
0,"I had this horrific driver named Maria Paola. I'm shocked at her 5 star reviews. When she arrived, she didn't even look at me. She probably took one glance at me, saw I was an ugly, stereotypical-looking Asian, and was disgusted. I got in, and she continued to stare straight ahead. I smiled and said a friendly ""Hi,"" and she barely said anything back. I told her where I wanted to go in a polite and friendly way, and she didn't respond. I could feel the DISDAIN and DISGUST from her through the entire ride. I respectfully asked her a question about Uber, since I hadn't ridden it many times before. She responded with curtness and condescension. I normally enjoy talking with people, but she looked so repulsed with me, from beginning to end, that I didn't dare converse with her. It was an incredibly awkward and painful ride. When we got near my destination, she rudely asked me if that was where it was. I patiently directed her to the actual destination nearby. Her condescension was very clear through her refusal to take a glance at me,   and curt answers. I could feel the disdain throughout the entire ride - it was hanging in the air. When I got off, she muttered something like ""Have a good one"" in the most robotic way, like she didn't mean it at all, and still stared straight ahead. She thought I was so gross, she never took a glance in my direction - I would probably blind her. :PThat was an extremely painful experience - but typical for what I get anywhere in SF. The disgust for what people WRONGLY see as lowly, unattractive, older, immigrant Asians is extreme in SF - and anywhere else. But, in fact, I'm US-born - much more American than she is - and probably younger than her. And I'm surely much cooler than she is. :P But she couldn't tell, and didn't want to know. I was surprised to see she had 5 stars on Uber - that means she's friendly, smiley, warm, and conversant with OTHER people. Other riders even wrote that she's ""friendly and approachable."" WOW, she was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE with me - and rude, too, with a repulsed vibe that was very obvious throughout the whole interaction. The disgust against Asians like me is more overt from non-Asian immigrants - and she must've been one, from Latin America. Uber - please fire her. ALL UBER DRIVERS need to treat ALL RIDERS with the same level of genuine warmth, friendliness, and care. Don't single out some riders for cold, rude, disgusted treatment for ANY REASON - especially if the riders are friendly, polite, well-dressed, and professional!Uber's response was uncaring and unprofessional. I don't think I'll ride Uber again. And please, BOYCOTT them."
0,"I was a frequent Uber customer, however after today I am so disgusted and disappointed to say the least with Uber. Long story short I typically take an Uber with my daughter when I am running late. Typically the ride is only 8.50 on average when it is raining the price goes up to about $12.50 as expected. I took an Uber this morning and I had a small spill of my coffee in the rubber carpet floor. I immediately told the driver and apologized as I was trying to put a seat belt in my daughter. He passed me one napkin and I tried to wipe it as best as possible."
1,I always felt safer or more secure with a female driver. Though I only had one guy who was bizarre I never let anyone even female drivers know I live alone. All drivers were prompt. Clean vehicles. Only one was slightly irritated because I had a few grocery bags.
1,"We have used Uber in many places in Europe and Canada. We have had a couple of inconveniences, but nothing really to report. We look forward to some sort of rideshare program coming to Vancouver, hopefully soon."
1,"WE love to use UBER, all of the drivers we have had are friendly, timely and are great drivers. I only rated the safety as a 4 as I hear lots of things occurring regarding ""fake"" UBER drivers. There has to be a better way of identifying the driver you are meeting. They are getting better and a lot has to do with the passenger as well."
0,My daughter ordered Uber to take myself and my grandchildren to a meeting. The car had a very dark interior. When he stopped at light he turned on the red light although there was a sign NO RIGHT ON RED. He missed a car by inches and kept going.
0,"Convenient, but not happy with 'peak' rates; hate drivers who rely so much on GPS; once had a driver go wrong way down one way street in NYC; hate the pressure to give 5 star ratings for experiences that are good but not great."
1,Far too overpriced. A ride of less than 10 miles is more than $25. I live in the 5th largest city in America so not sure if this posts a part? This is my biggest reason for not utilizing the service more.
0,"I was in San Francisco last weekend. Between my sister and myself, Uber cancelled on us 8 times. Where is the credit for them cancelling? This was a big problem because they didn't cancel right away, so several times the car icon was getting closer and then turning around. The drivers we did have were very nice but most of them had no idea about the directions. One even got out and ran across the street to ask someone. I'm going to switch to Lyft."
1,The biggest problem I have with Uber is the difference in time from what the app shows to actually getting in the car. I use Uber in many locations. Some places don't have too many cars around. So when the app says 12 minutes but it turns into 22 minutes it messes with my scheduling. Please be more accurate with your projected time from ordering the ride to the ride showing up at meeting place.
1,"My daughter called for an Uber pick up and was told no driver was available. She called a few more times in hopes that a driver would become available. She was charged $510 (5x $102), but no driver ever showed. Uber refuses to refund the $$. They are insisting that the refund must come from my daughter's bank. It is illegal to be charged for rides that never came. Uber repeatedly stated that no driver was available and yet they charged her anyway!!!"
1,"I tried to do instant pay at Wawa. Called. They said I needed to update my card info. When I did that it refused to let me update because of a security issue. I called. The guy said he couldn't help me. I asked for a manager and he continued to argue with me. I had to keep telling him to put someone else on the phone. I had to hang up and call back. Got someone else. He told me I'd just have to wait 45 minutes. So I waited. Updated the card info. Went to go instant pay... Locked me out of the system again saying security issue. Called back. Got the first guy again. Great I thought. I could hear plenty of people laughing in the background. He put me on hold saying it was to pull up my info, but really it was to wait for them to quiet down."
1,They extort money from people and get away with it. For example I bought an Uber card for 40.00 and it wouldn't work. Their answer was that I owed 20.00 to them when in fact it is impossible to owe Uber anything. So money was taken from us and we could never get it back. I am not the only person that has been stolen from in this way.
0,"I have had a few great experiences and a couple of bad experiences. Worst experience was being picked up in an emergency situation when I needed to get to the hospital to visit someone. I was in a hurry and we were already on the highway when I realized the driver reeked of alcohol and was completely intoxicated, weaving in and out of lanes and could not keep the car between the lanes. The second time with Uber that was bad was when the driver made a couple of stops along the way taking me to my destination. These stops were in a shady part of town and I was scared to death."
0,"I ordered an Uber at the airport for me my boyfriend and his parents so 4 people and a couple luggages. The Uber pulled over, opened his truck and suddenly closed it and said We were too many passengers (which we weren't) and told me to cancel the ride 'cause he wouldn't take us and just drove off. I was really upset and cancelled as per the driver's instruction and was charged a 5$ cancellation fee. I've been talking back and forth with Uber customer service for 4 days now and they refuse to credit me the fee even though they admit I'm right and apologized for the bad experience. Their reasoning is that too many fare adjustments were made on my account (which were warranted 'cause I was indeed overcharged on a few trips). This completely irrelevant and a completely separate issue and they're nickel and diming me over 5$. This makes absolutely no sense. The customer service quality has gone downhill from before."
1,"My wife and I are in our 70s and usually only use Uber when traveling out of our own area. Still, I'd say we've used Uber about 2 dozen times because we like to travel. All our experiences except two have been positive and those two weren't all that bad or scary just inconvenient. We flit back and forth from Uber to Lyft depending on where we are; some places tend to have more of an Uber presence, some more of a Lyft presence. Both are good values, overall."
0,"The driver was late and he smelled badly. He was rude and a bit disconcerting. I considered not staying in the car, but I was going to be late if I waited for another ride. I wish I had done that."
1,I rate Uber lower since they added per minute charges. Their appeal came from the flat fee which set them apart from taxis' services. Additionally there is no way to get a specific driver if you like riding with them.
1,Thrifty for short trips when you have limited time and no car. Longer distances can be pricey and I generally like cheaper bus or rail if available. Or sometimes you can rent a car for a day for $15 or less.
1,"Uber has provided me and my family with a quick and easy way to get around that doesn't break the bank. I have had very few issues with Uber, the toughest part is usually when travelling internationally, trying to get picked up in multi-level airport parking structures."
1,"I've never had a negative experience with Uber. It was the one I downloaded first while in college and the one I've continue to use these past 3 or so years. Some experiences have been better than others but in my opinion the drivers probably have had a worse experience. The rides I've enjoyed the most were the ones when myself and the driver have respected each other's privacy, acted courteously and professional. I have witnessed people trash and throw up all over a driver's car, and that's not alright. I think the thing that has begun to creep into the way I view Uber is all of its negative publicity. Why would I support an enterprise that I don't agree with? It's not like I am dependent on Uber. I can use other ridesharing apps, I can use a traditional taxi, I can even use public transportation. Despite all of this, I still use Uber but that might not always be the case."
1,Saw 3 cars on map and none would come not a big enough fair for them. Stranded handy caped passenger.
1,"Horrible experienced. I lost my personal belonging at one of theirs Uber car and I have emailed helpline with all pictures of the lost item and drivers details. But just because trip has not been booked from account no one is going to help. I spoke with phone helpline supervisor Angela and she told me clearly that she will not get in touch with driver to ask about my lost item just because the trip has not been booked from my account besides that I have all necessary drivers and trip details. Angela told me too that Uber doesn't have complains email, how convenient isn't it. Well I think it's time to start use other apps as this days Uber is getting too expensive and as you can tell does care about their passengers and their belongings as they are only an agent."
1,"This company should be out of business... I returned to Uber after 1 1/2 years just to make a little money to pay a bill. I drover March 9 and 10 for about a 1 each day. I made $68.27. I needed the money fast to pay a bill on Monday March 11, I tried to cash out and they stop me from cashing out... They kept saying something was wrong with my bank information... How can that be when I've had the same bank information for over 5 years and the same as when I drove for them a year and a half ago."
1,"Some of the rides were great, some were awful. One car had no A/C, another car had a seat full of crumbs that I had to sit in, another car had all the seats slashed, another was not the car I asked for, but a very high Chevy Truck I could not get into. I had to go inside the doctor's office, where I had just left, to get a stool so I could climb into the truck. The Uber driver refused to cancel as he would be penalized, and I refused to cancel for the same reason. To end the stalemate, I was lucky the doctor's office had a stool. Uber is great for when you need a ride and are unable to drive for medical or other reasons. However, Uber does not seem to have any consensus control over the cars people are driving. Out of all the rides I needed, 50% were great and 50% were awful. I am thankful I am able to drive again."
1,"Uber does a good job of providing the service, but lately their fares have been going up and they now have discontinued the express pool service. The idea is to give a more affordable method of transportation, right?"
1,Customer service sucks. You make a complaint against a driver & nothing happens. They work on a star rating but after complaints stars remain the same. I only use Uber because it's cheaper than taxi. Also communicating with driver is difficult because English is not their native tongue. As for the app they use to travel needs some serious looking at. It takes the long way home.
0,"I have always been skeptical about rideshare services because of the news reports of assaults and robberies. I used this company for the first time earlier this year during a trip for a conference in Las Vegas. My first ride was excellent and was completed without a problem. My second ride was a little scary. I requested a ride but then my phone died. I was with a friend. While I was trying to recharge my phone, my friend came to me to tell me that our ride had arrived As we got in the car, I had an uneasy feeling. I started asking the driver ""who"" he was there to pick up and if he knew where we were going. He never gave me a straight answer and my friend had already told him where we were going. "
1,"I ordered on 12 March-19 at around 12:40 PM then order confirm and then after 15 mins I received delivery boy contact number so I called him but his number not reachable and after 5 mins it's showing on the way, then again I called him but still not contacted then I called customer care. One executive received my call (VIKAS). He told me, ""Sir please wait for some time. Order is on the way and I also tried to contact with delivery person, but it's not contactable so please wait for some time."""
1,I've used Uber 3 times now to go local places usually 10 miles or less. All guy drivers and it's definitely scary getting into a car with a stranger. I would call a regular taxi company if I needed a ride at night and I was alone. I don't trust Uber to do a good job of vetting their drivers.
0,"Uber is great for infrequent rides like to events at small venues, trips to the airport, etc. It features reasonable convenience and cost; however, surge pricing punished folks who had come to depend on Uber for more frequent usage."
1,"I have used Uber and always had a great driver and no problems. However, the safety of it does freak me out. But it's JUST like a taxi right? It is a great way to get around especially on vacations! So is the taxi. I'm not sure why I feel more comfortable in a cab without knowing the driver than an Uber. Maybe I've just watched too many TV shows."
0,I am very pleased with the service and the professionalism of the drivers. I am a travel nurse and I am in different states often and I use Uber and I am never disappointed with the drivers. They are courteous and on time to pick me up. I feel safe when I'm in the vehicle on a trip.
0,Great ride to big airport in Houston at 6am. A Courteous and very safe driver picked up in Westheimer area and driven to airport before high traffic time. Will do it again in a heartbeat before driving and having to park.
0,"I have contacted Uber 8 times over 2 months about a driver that STILL HAS my phone to this day. Their answer, long story short? Deal with it, not our problem. It's incredible for a company this huge to provide such horrible customer service. There's no number you can call them to in Australia. Literally no way you can TALK to one of their customer service staff. Each and every single time I opened a helped ticket, it was closed before the issue was resolved, making it impossible for me to contact whoever I talked to before, and making me go through all the steps to contact them once again. Never using Uber again."
1,Rideshare is one of the greatest innovations of our time. It's convenient and helpful to a large number of people. I have concerns about safety for the drivers as well as the passengers. The navigation also needs a lot of improvement.
1,"Think twice before using this service. The drivers are often obnoxious or have an attitude, and the cars not large enough to hold luggage if you need to go to the airport or to a cruise terminal. What good does a Honda Civic or Ford Fiesta do in that instance?? A briefcase and the trunk is full. Would be better off using my own car and going to long term parking or taking a train. Total waste of time. And if you say something, the driver gets offended and obnoxious."
0,"Convenient for in town trips. No issues and drivers are friendly. The value is fair, I am very much happy to see women drive Uber in our country. I wish them success. Still need to try longer distanced trips. Thank you."
1,I started using Uber about a year ago. I like Uber because it convenient. It takes me to and from work. To the movies I use it when I go out. On The town. Most of the people are friendly and they are there on time. I really like Uber.
0,The service has been fine in the some 20 times I have used Uber. The only problem has been with the tipping practices that are presented after the ride. Sometimes the software malfunctions and I am unable to show my appreciation to the Uber driver who gave me the ride. Thanks.
1,They own their cars. They are clean and don't smell. They are motivated and speak to us as punters as opposed to taxi drivers who often smell and don't give a jot and often try and cheat by driving the wrong routes to bump up the fare. The taxis are also sometimes wrecks in need of repair or replacement.
0,No problems gate codes or other info they need when getting the ride as long as I check what the app says my location is versus just pinpointing through app. Can always send note to driver to correct or clarify location.
1,"I CALLED FROM HOSPITAL TO GET RIDE HOME AFTER SURGERY,I WAS WHEELED DOWN TO ENTRANCE OF JFK MEDICAL CENTER GOT INTO UBER CAR HE TOLD ME I CANCLED RIDE AND WOULD NOT TAKE ME HOME.HE SAID HE HAD ANOTHER FAIR AND MADE ME GET OUT.THIS IS BULL $#*!,AND THEY CAN STICK THEIR 6$ CANCEL FEE YOU KNOW WHERE.I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN."
1,"I decided to try Uber and get a ride from the local airport. I downloaded the app and booked my first Uber ride. I was watching my ride get closer and closer and I found out the name of the driver and type of car I was to be looking for. Once my ride arrived, I was welcomed by the driver that I was expecting except for there was another person waiting for the same Uber. I waited a long time for this Uber since it was 11 pm and snowing. Needless to say, the other person got the Uber because her name was on his phone. I even showed the guy my phone and when I ordered the ride which was before the other rider. I was livid. I ended having to find a cab and paying a ton more for a short ride to my car. I will never again support Uber or recommend Uber to anyone."
0,"It is such a convenience and safety is a definite. They are very professional and they just make things a whole lot easier. They also have like discounts at times. App is great, timing is great. Their prices are just right and fair."
0,"Drivers were close by every time I requested a pickup. Definitely a plus when you're kind of in a hurry. All vehicles were clean and dent free. As the drivers go each were pleasant to speak with. In general my experience was great overall. Just a little odd when deciding how much to tip, not sure how much of a tip they get from the company itself."
0,Uber is very helpful for me as I feel safe knowing that someone could track who I was riding with and where I went. So person would have to be very crazy to harm me under those circumstances. I also don't have to have cash or give my credit card to an individual. The vehicles are much nicer than any taxi that I have ever ridden in before using Uber.
0,"I use the service at least 5 days per week and generally get excellent service. And when there has been an issue the Co. has made thing right. My only complaint is that it is difficult to communicate with them, especially if it is a complaint not listed on the frequently asked questions"
1,"The Drivers have vehicles that are unsafe. Either picking you up in a car that has been wrecked, driving on spare tire or smelly cars. The drivers try and be courteous but they drive too too fast and unsafe."
1,"I was recently left stranded by an Uber driver who canceled my pick up when he was only 1 minute away after I had been waiting for him for 15 minutes. He gave me no explanation. The Uber app automatically reassigned me another driver, but I had to cancel this one because I no longer had time to wait for another driver who was 20 minutes away. I was going to miss my bus to the airport."
0,"I was recently rear ended by an Uber driver. I wasn't a customer or using them. The driver informed me that he didn't have insurance, so I asked to take a picture of his driver's license which turned out to just be an identification card and not a license. I tried to call Uber and the automated message hung up on me. It seems like I have to download their app in order to make any complaints or inform them of the situation. I'm trying to let them know that this guy shouldn't be a driver for them."
0,Uber allow only drivers who been approved thru their background check and follow all community guidelines which allows passengers to be feel free with ride Uber partnerships so both drivers and passengers comfortably taking care their business.
0,"Fun time with meeting an Uber driver. Was our first ride in Tampa, and he was awesome to recommend places. We gave him an extra tip. Wasn't pushy. Wasn't hard to talk with. Very outgoing. Knew the area well."
0,"I have used Uber in Portland, OR, Houston and Norfolk, VA. I have found the service to be good. My best rides are when the driver gets out to find me. Sometimes at busy airports it is hard to find your Uber especially at night. The texting for the driver helps also. It was always appreciated when the driver took the luggage to the door."
0,"Rideshare really impacts the cost of the ride, I feel it's a fantastic bargain. I am alerted beforehand of the expected arrival time of both pickup and drop-off before selecting and can easily to determine if time allows for pooling the ride. I have yet to have a bad experience."
0,"I've had a really great experience with Uber as a customer. I've been lucky to have had professional, timely, and friendly drivers who easily put me at ease, and got me to my destination safely, and in a timely manner."
1,"I have used them in the past while traveling to and from the mainland. After all I have heard and read in the news, I will no longer trust these services. As a senior, I worry they will beat me up and rob me."
0,Uber is on so fast haven't had any issues with the company or any of the drivers. I'm always nervous getting a ride from someone I don't know but that is why I count on the Uber company to research the people that work for them...
0,"I live in a small town which has typically on 3 Uber cars available which is fine. When I go to NYC, I use Uber almost exclusively because they are reliable, the app is very informative, and I can also select a large vehicle when needed as well as schedule in advance, a pick-up. I have never had an issue with Uber drivers in NYC."
1,"I like the service, it is convenient to order food. Uber has many varieties of restaurants to choose from. The food is delivered. This is a good service for busy people. It is also convenient for getting to your destination."
1,"I read the Reddit forum about Uber and am very concerned about what I see. Murders, rapes, fasle charges, non-show. However, I can not determine how much of this is false. Never-the-less I am concerned about the safety and reliability of Uber drivers. My personal experiences in using 6-8 trips has been great. As a senior who drives my car only 500 miles a year, I see Uber as a great money saver. If/when I am unable to drive and/or give up my car I will definitely use Uber or Lyft."
0,"In my experience, Uber Drivers always show up on time. I never have to wait long and they are always pleasant. The vehicles are clean and roomy, when needed. When traveling, the drivers are always helpful and they give recommendations on great places to eat and different sites to tour."
0,"I've found their service to be top notch. The app is wonderfully efficient. The ability to track the progress of your ride is very comforting. And, the prices for the rides are very good. All the drivers I've had are very nice."
0,"My limited experience was good, having a picture of the car and driver ahead of time was nice. However, after hearing about the Uber driver that left an out of town group stranded at a gas station in an unfamiliar town then yelling political insults as he drove away horrified me. The fact that the company backed the driver makes me very hesitant to use them again."
0,"First time using Uber on a very busy NBA All Stars day in Charlotte, NC. We needed to get to the train station so decided to use Uber - the driver took a little while to get to us (no fault of his due to all the security all around) but once he found us he was very cordial - price was right - no complaints."
0,"I have used this service a few times, the only issue I had was updating my address. I still can't figure out where that is on my app. My delivery driver always has to call me to get my address. But other than that I feel this is a great service and it kinda sucks that you need to get a business license now to be a driver. Hope rates don't go up."
0,"It's very clean than yellow. Driver too. Car is spacious than yellow cab. I don't have shake a hand to catch a yellow cab before, even bad weather. They come to my place directly to pick me up, and I go Long Island, no extra charge."
0,"Uber does not address fraud. I've been trying two months to get refunded for a fraudulent cleaning fee. My son rode and I paid. The photos sent were fraudulent. The help robots cannot make any decisions and just regurgitate past answers that don't fit the situation. My son gave permission for me to work the issue but even with his permission, HELP will not listen or correct the fraud from this driver. How can anyone trust a company that treats customers with a total lack of regard?"
1,I took a trip with Uber and their GPS stopped working so he had to use MY phone and the GPS from Google maps to get me to my appointment. I was late then had to reschedule my appointment which was important. I asked for a refund but they offered me 5 dollars off my next ride. I told them I wasn't going to use Uber again because this was not the first time I have had issues using their service. They refused to refund me and I am trying to find a number to contact their headquarters but it isn't available. Terrible business and I won't use them ever again!
1,"This was the most terrible trip I have had with Uber. This is not acceptable as an Amex platinum member I should receive top notch service as per the Amex platinum/Uber partnership program, and this was anything but that. My driver was completely lost and did not know where to go as I was only attempting to get to the airport. He says his GPS did not work and even mentioned that he hates Uber and always tells customers to choose Lyft instead. As a result I arrived at airport 25 minutes late and missed my flight. After complaint to the company for this instance, Uber did nothing except offer to refund the ""extra money"" that was unexpectedly charged due to the additional distance because of the driver getting lost. Listen to this Uber driver employee and use Lyft instead as I will going forward."
1,"INCORRECT trip. I've sent many proofs to confirm this wasn't my trip. The pickup was ** to 59 Canal. Driver was stuck in traffic downtown Brooklyn by the Barclay, my son missed his 9 pm bus to go back to school, so I canceled the trip. The driver tried to extort my then 17 yr old son for cash to bring him back. I spoke to her on the phone. She told me to order another car so she can intercept it, I said ok. She then changed her mind and kicked my son out in the middle of nowhere downtown BK. ANYTHING COULD'VE HAPPENED TO MY SON! Now I'm stuck with this bill after I paid what I owed on top of that. I've tried to resolve this many times but, to no avail. And the driver reported a bogus trip."
1,Uber has been ripping its drivers off and need a class action lawsuit against them for doing so on several occasions. I've reached out to them about trips I completed with them and never got paid for. I completed a delivery and was not paid for doing so on several occasions and the customer service sucks and require us to email them to get help. They ask you to wait 24/48 hours to be paid but they never pay you.
0,I have used Uber two times and both rides were comfortable and the drivers were courteous and professional. I didn't encounter any problems and would use Uber again if the need arises. I don't have any complaints at this time.
0,"I like the idea that you can see where they are and exactly when they will arrive. I've only used them for short distances but they're always on time, very cordial, and never driving too fast! The fare is very cheap! I would never call a taxi again, unless that was my only alternative."
0,"I like that you can see exactly how much the ride will cost before committing, so there is no chance that a driver will drive all over town to raise the fee. I also like that I have never had to wait for more than 15 minutes for a ride. Tipping is optional, but I usually tip."
1,"It's a wonderful concept and great most of the time. But it scares me a little bit. Ninety nine out of 100 times will be safe, you'll be so glad that you did it. But it's going to be that rare time, and has been times, when it wasn't safe. Thus, I'm scared to do it as a single female. It's safer as a group."
0,Using this is convenient. I like the fact that sometimes when I don't want to drive I can use Uber to get where I need to go. The only thing I dislike is when you share rides you have to meet at a certain location and it confused the consumer so that could be straightened out. I think it would really help a lot of people when you're sharing rides and you're on a budget according to your financial status does. This would help improve when consumers and how they use Uber in the future.
0,"I have only used Uber. 90% of the times, service has been excellent, car are clean and drivers are friendly and pleasant-mannered. Other times car are dirty and drivers are smelly. Next time will try Lyft."
0,It would be helpful if the drivers spoke English. It makes me wonder how they got their driver's license without knowing English. I had one driver do a good job but was upset and I had no way to talk to him and find out what he wanted me to do because he didn't speak or understand English. Does Uber care about the language skills? Does Uber double check to see if the drivers have legal licenses?
0,This service is wonderful when you are on vacation. Leave your hotel and have transportation easily available. Drivers usually know the area. I did have one incident where the driver had no idea how to get to an address...but solved that with my own directions!
1,"There are too many issues with safety and abuse. After trying Uber, I just prefer the safety and predictability of a regular cab service. My driver made me uncomfortable, for the small amount extra I pay, for the amount I use a cab, I cannot justify using Uber. Maybe if I needed a cab more often I would think differently, and I do believe that companies like Uber are changing the playing field, but not for me."
0,"I find ridesharing services invaluable. From a business perspective, I much prefer using ridesharing over rental cars and certainly over taxis. The convenience and cost can't be beat. I also often use them for personal reasons over driving myself. With parking rates approaching $70/day in San Francisco, ridesharing quickly becomes cost-effective and eliminates any issues with drinking and driving."
0,"The cost as a rider seems to have increased. One way to work costs $25. So it would cost $300 for a six week. Is it possible to purchase a book of passes? The drivers and service have always been great, it's just the cost of the ride."
1,"I try to avoid rideshare if possible because of the uncertainty of when the vehicle will actually arrive. The arrival time keeps changing as other passengers are added to the list of pick-ups. The last time I used ride-share, I waited about 20 minutes for a car to arrive."
1,"My husband and I arranged a ride to the airport with Uber. We were notified the evening before our ride that our ride had been set up. When the time for our pick up, with no driver in sight, had come and gone by not just a few minutes but by almost 30 minutes we realized we had to get ourselves to the airport in order to catch our flight. This not only caused a lot of undue stress but a whole lot of money. We had to pay for 2 days of parking at the airport and for someone to pick up our vehicle. When trying to issue a complaint to Uber about this matter, they have been unresponsive. We will NEVER trust Uber again. This has NEVER happened to us with a taxi service."
0,"I had a pre scheduled uber ride on 02/22/2018.  I received a notice that the UBER driver, Charles had arrived at my home, but no UBER car outside. I walked the block to locate the UBER driver with no success. Then. UBER charged me for a missed ride.  Bad UBER!!!"
1,"I correctly entered in the destination on the app but when the driver arrived he couldn't take me because he showed my pick up location as the destination, on his phone. So he had to leave without giving me a ride. I canceled my Uber account immediately and got Lyft, which completed my ride. Uber has no personalized customer service for their customers. It's all robotic ""check item below that best describes your issue"" then read the advice. THE WORST ONLINE-SERVICE COMPANY IN THE WORLD."
1,Today I booked Uber cab at 7:55pm. Estimated time was 4min. He took long time to reach the location. As I am patient recently I have undergone surgery. Due to delay from driver I have to bear a pain and swollen. Who is responsible for same?
0,"My purse was stolen by my Uber driver. I left it in backseat around 9:30a on 2/25/19, and this guy tipped myself $27 on a $13.50 trip then did extra rides for himself using my Uber account, yep he change my pw kicking me and my daughter out of the app. How you ask, because my personal cell with app access was in his car (currently using work cell) in the purse he stole. Using my locator app I saw he went across the bridge back to NJ so it adds more proof. Then he lies to Uber rep, saying he didn't have my bag yet when I threatened to go to the police he lies again saying he dropped it at 3 separate locations. So, if he didn't have it as he told Uber, why claim you dropped of a bag you never had... LIES!"
0,"Ordered UBER and driver never turned up, charged 23.59 pounds. UBER said my fault as I did not cancel trip. After waiting for over 30 minutes and driver never turned up even though app said driver 11 minutes away over and over. UBER should give the option of customer being able to call driver from app like other companies."
0,"I don't like taxi, but I trust only this company. The price is ok and their drivers are always polite."
0,"My driver falsified my delivery, the customer service representative reiterated obvious information with no plan of action, and the manager tried to reassure me with a 100% refund that's mandatory. By the end of the call, the restaurant I ordered from closed and UberEATS management replied, â€œWell, there's other places you can order from in the areaâ€. Absolutely incompetent company with poor standards and a lack of accountability for their actions."
0,"Use Uber all the time and only a few times with issues. Canceled me once, rescheduled and guy still came on time. A lot of the drivers are certainly above the average cab driver. Clean newer cars, no smoke and speak English!"
0,"They never showed up for the taxis we booked, they cancelled them and then charged me each time Â£6 cancellation fee. My clients were 45 minutes late as a result of me having to keep rebooking taxis with them. As a result I lost a large contract, as well as them trying to continually take payments from my account until my bank stopped all payments. When I complained about this issue I have have had no resolution and they still owe me a significant amount of money. We will never use them ever again. Trust your local taxi firms instead to turn up and not rip you off."
0,I drive for Uber/Uber Eats. Whenever a situation occurs and support is needed the headache begins. They are completely scripted responses. They do not actually respond to the situation but instead say it will be looked into. They then email days later and again give a script response. Never actually addressing the questions or issues. Very difficult for both customer and drivers. With customer service being what it is I would suggest avoiding Uber.
0,"I am a Uber user and I really love using this application especially when you go home late night. Recently, my friends and I went to a house party. We took Uber to get home, we were little tipsy at that time. I was sitting in front of the car and after five minutes I told to driver that he needs to pull over because I was going to throw up. He eventually pull over the car and I clearly puked outside, the flow of our travel was smooth, the driver was fine. However, the fare was also fine when we got home. Few days later, Uber sent me an email that the driver charged me $80 for vomiting inside his car. I called Uber service to complain but they did not solve my problem. Ever since that happened, I became more careful using this application. Furthermore, I do not have any bad intentions for the Uber company. I am just here to share my experience with Uber to inform other users that they may encounter this kind of scenario."
1,"Today we used the Uber app to try to get a ride to work for my daughter. After request, the phone rings and it is the requested driver informing us that because of the weather (winter in Michigan) it would cost us a surcharge of $20 because he had to switch from his car to his truck. I do not see how his switching vehicles becomes our financial burden. Uber needs to set limits on things and not allow their drivers to charge customers what they want. They already started charging more in general, now service charges before you even get a Uber. Sucks, this used to be a good service."
1,"I have been using Uber for years but after a bad experience this past Friday I think I'm done. After a two week business trip in Detroit, I arrived back to the DC area and found myself in need for a ride from Dulles Airport to my office in order to get my car and drive home (about 5 miles). I didn't feel like waiting in line for a cab so I ordered an UberX. Not two seconds (literally two seconds) after hitting confirm my phone rang. I answered and the person on the other line identified himself as my driver and asked where I was. I was stunned to say the least but luckily I was already closing in on my walk to the pickup location. He asked where I was going and I told him the name of my company. He asked â€œIs that in DC?â€ To which I told him no, it is in Herndon just a few miles from the airport. He said ok and he'd be right there."
1,"Uber, not the driver, double charged me for the tip I left for the driver. The tip was debited twice, on two different days. When I contacted Uber, they refused to acknowledge that this happened, even though my PayPal and bank account clearly show the deduction twice."
0,Cab no. **. Driver name Anil **. I booked my cab from New Delhi railway station to my home and by mistake I left my phone in cab. My driver didn't returned my phone. Moreover misbehave with me as he was having no fear of Uber or Uber policies are in favor of him only. After that I visited Uber office Gurgaon also but no one helped me there. Also I don't understand what type of system these people are following and who is supporting this system a company where customer service is not there and there is no one to complain also.
0,"Scheduled an Uber ride 2 days in advance to get to my airline flight at the airport. When the time approached, the app said to be prepared because pick up would occur at the scheduled time. I stood out in the rain with my bags waiting for the driver. No one showed. The app changed from pick up at the appointed time to pick up ""soon."" After 40 minutes of panicking and trying to contact Uber, I gave up and contacted a taxi company that fortunately was able to pick me up and get me to the airport in time for my flight. The taxi company was small and the owner picked me up himself otherwise I would have lost all the money for my airline tickets and prepaid hotel reservations."
0,I made an order through Uber Eats. After waiting around for the driver who didn't respond my ordered was cancelled and they kept my money. Avoid ordering through them at all costs. They will keep your money and not deliver services.
1,"I'm a frequent uber user and I had no problems until this uber pool decided to introduce the short walk crap. I'm always having issues with the drivers, as I see an address and the driver sees another address. And a cancellation fee? Are you serious? There are many incompetent drivers out there so why do I have to pay $5 fee when they cancel? I'm saying bye to this service and I will make sure all my friends are aware of your games."
1,"My daughter and I use Uber frequently and loved it. Lately I've noticed that drivers are charging a ""surcharge"" and ""wait"" charge on EVERY trip I've made without my knowledge. The numbers on the mailbox on the road and house are clear and can be read from any direction but yet you continue to park and wait across the street where no one can see you. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and needed picked up. I was charged .75 wait because I had to load my groceries and my child into the vehicle... Nonsense. And a 2.25 surcharge for who knows what. I'm done being a customer. You've lost my business."
0,"Everytime Uber makes an update it inconveniences its riders more and more. The update to the GPS has caused so much confusion for me and my drivers. Most of the time the address takes me to the back of the building I ask to go. Also this new Uber pool walking thing in the middle of winter is a horrible idea. The whole point of us using Uber instead of riding buses is so that we can get dropped off and picked up at our door not walk two blocks in the cold. And you shouldn't have to pay extra just to avoid walking, I've had drivers cancel either way so we were better off without that update. Uber used to seem to care more about its customers, I wish it would go back to being that way. I've been riding Ubers since the beginning."
0,"When Uber runs over its customers.  Buyer betware - Ueber is not all that is seems.  At first I liked it. Ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people.  But it's a crap shoot.  I'd estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them Uber has no customer support.  There's no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company.  Case in point:  Take Bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination.  Bill drives a Grand Cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime.  When Bill dropped me off at Planet Fitness I immediately noticed I left my bag containing an IPod and Bose headphones in the back seat. About $600 worth of equipment.  I tried to wave him down but he wouldn't stop.  Since then I have sent over 30 texts to him, the local Ueber office, and the corporate hub in Stamford.  I even asked the Stamford police to investigate.  As of this moment neither Bill nor Uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service.  The car will get you from point A to poing B but after that your on your own.  Uber won't lift a finger to help.  Do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet, or keys, or handbag, or smartphone, or lose engagement ring on your finger? The smart answer is no. Bill is still out there. Lyft is the same as Uber.  I'll check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than Uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance, even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars."
0,"I was in Madrid with my wife and it was around 8 pm in front of El Corte Ingles, big store like Macy's, so we decide to call Uber for get a ride to the hotel. We wait over 45 minutes, Uber never arrive. But the surprise was that Uber charge to my credit card $ 7.00 Euros ($9.00 US money twice total $18.00 US). On top of that they said that I took the ride to my hotel and the place another charge for $69.00 US. I dispute to the Bank of America for over two months, finally the bank say I have not prove of been or not taking the ride, therefore, ""Sorry we can't give you the refund."" So the Bank of America protect Uber, not the customer and to me Uber in Spain is totally a scam. Taxis in Madrid are excellent, inexpensive courteous driver and the best is that they're all over the city of Madrid."
0,Uber is the worst service provider ever. I booked a cab from Yeshwantput to Marathalli which cost 320-350 RS. The driver stopped the cab after few min in a highway and said he cannot go any further as the mode of payment was online and he doesn't have the money to put petrol. The trip cost me 80 RS and after then when I booked another cab I had to pay 550 so in total I had to pay more than 600 rs. I want to know who will pay the extra charge that I had to bear.
0,"I have had some very positive experiences with Uber, but two experiences were terrible. The first bad experience I had was a driver criticized me for not being able to drive myself. The second happened this morning (1/6/19). I had ordered an Uber at 7:02 a.m. and saw that the driver was only six minutes away which would've been more than enough time to get me to work at 7:30. I kept an eye on my Uber app to see how close the driver was and noticed at 7:10 they were about a block away. I waited in front of my house for 22 minutes and when I saw they hadn't moved since 7:10 I was forced to cancel my ride and call a taxi. Not only was I 15 minutes late to my job, but I was also charged a cancelation fee."
0,"Charged a no-show fee for a malfunction in driver's Uber app.   (3rd person button in shared ride wouldn't light up so the ride wouldn't start.)  Driver tried to fix the glitch for 10 long minutes.  Then he said nicely, we would have to all get out and start our ride search over again.  (in frigid weather at Laguardia airport.)  We were all charged a no-show fee.  My co-rider found no way to contact any customer support at UBER."
1,"Girlfriend ask me to send her an Uber, so l ordered the economic or pool which US$3.30. l provided the exact address of my girlfriend which was going to ride to my apt. Well after a while UBER sent me a text that the ride was canceled by driver, and also to try one more time with another driver. Well l tried, so finally succeed, but the driver could not find the address l provided. He went to another address, but finally reached the destination provided. l called the driver and he told me that he was sent to another address, but the address l provided was accurate. But as l said before, finally reached my girlfriend and brought her to her destination."
0,"Uber is a great business idea, in theory. Employ ambitious people willing to provide a cheap taxi service using their own vehicles for those brave souls willing to get into a stranger's messy car with the expectation of getting to their destination alive and in one piece for an agreeable price. Less costly than a limo, and far better than collecting returnable cans and bottles from the roadside for those seeking easy cash income. Win-win, right? Not so fast. Without delving into the obvious, the possibility of slipping into the back seat of a serial killer or the rolling annex of a hoarder's hovel, allow me to address the drivers here, who have only recently been permitted to receive and expect a TIP from their passengers, in addition to their 70% share of the cost of an Uber ride from their (yes, brave) fares."
0,"Ordered food through UberEats. Driver ran away with food. Uber charges me for the food anyway stating that's their policy. Contacting customer service certifies that there isn't a concept of service, the agents only correspond via email and have kept on sending generic comments without attempting to understand what may have happened. Every correspondence is abruptly closed without any resolution. When I posted a review on the Google play store, the company immediately responds that I can contact them for assistance. When I did that the same circus started again. This is the worst customer service by any standard."
0,"On Tuesday December 24, 2018 at about 5:37 am I opened the Uber app on my tablet and immediately confirmed a pick for $13.92 (pool). The car came by at about 5:39/5:40 am. Slowed down as I was approaching, sped off about a block, slowed down again and did a u-turn to the opposite side of the street. All this time I began running after it. I caught it at the stop light, opened the door and got in. He claimed he did not see me coming after him. This was strange, the street was empty, early morning and with my hands waving I was unseen? God bless there was the stop light that have him came to a complete stop."
0,"My daughter used Uber services to take a ride to her destination in Philadelphia. After exiting the car and crossing the street, the Uber driver hit her with the car knocking her to the ground. Once she got up, the Uber driver returned to her car and drove away, leaving my daughter standing at the curb. Unacceptable. Highly recommend not using over services. Only reason I am giving this one star is because it will not let me proceed with this comment without giving it at least 1 star."
0,"I scheduled a driver for three hours away, for when I needed to go to the airport. One showed up immediately, and then charged me a 'cancellation fee' for not being packed. Uber said they would cancel it. But they only gave me a credit toward a future ride. They refused to refund it, as any ethical company would do. So they made a big profit of $6 on the deal. Because I do not deal with unethical companies. Lyft is just fine."
0,"I took a ride on Sunday evening and didn't touch alcohol that night, absolutely no incident happened inside the car that night. Today I am being charged 150$ for a cleaning service!!! Drivers are scamming customers, making up stories so they can get extra cash. Uber should be ashamed of the service that they have been providing. It's very unethical and embarrassing for the company to keep people like that."
0,"When I scheduled Uber to pick me up at 6AM and take me to the airport, the instructions I received stated that the driver would arrive between 6 and 6:10, and I would be charged every minute I was late. The driver arrived at 6am, I walk out at 6:05 only to find that the driver left!!! Luckily, I had a car and there was enough time to drive to the airport and park my car. Otherwise, I would've have missed my flight!"
0,I have been riding Uber premier cars for the past 2-years in various Indian cities. What I have seen is that the 100% of Indian Uber drivers as all the other taxi drivers in the country do not close their windows and use air-conditioning or heater (in winter) when they are not on a trip with their riders. The Uber drivers thus maintain a filthy interior with dusts of all kinds on all the cars along with mosquitoes freely 'roaming' inside the cars.
0,"Recently bought an Uber with a few friends in Grand Rapids, MI. Once we got in his car he refused to drive us anywhere unless we gave him extra cash. My friend refused to let us give cash because she recently had been in another Uber in New York City who demanded extra cash and then kicked her out of his car. Never riding Uber again."
0,"If your son/daughter uses Uber - beware. My son recently used Uber and was charged a $150 cleaning fee. The driver submitted pictures taken from someone else's ride, and claimed the mess was made by him and his girlfriend. He contacted Uber to refute these charges, and told them to check the date and time on the picture. Uber said they didn't have that information. Apparently they believe whatever their drivers tell them. He went back and forth with Uber. Finally, I sent an email and told them the driver would have that info, and we would seek legal counsel if necessary. They soon refunded his money. On a Google search, I found out many Uber drivers do this. They often set up their car to show a mess, use the same pictures over and over again, and even have a bank of ""messy car"" pictures they submit. My advice - take pictures of the inside of the car before you leave."
0,"No show. Never again. Airport. Uber booked for 0815. 0810 driver cancelled. 0815 booked another. 0840 driver phoned - can't find the address. 0850 driver cancelled. 0855. Panicking. Tried again. 0915 Uber arrived, not mine. Driver said would cancel client and take me for 30 euros."
0,"I needed to grab a ride in pouring rain for 3-4 blocks. I'd been given a code for discount ride that was never credited. Then found another charge of $40 on my card. When I made a complaint their answer was I had made a mess requiring cleaning. First off there is no way I'd made a mess with 1 small bag and just sitting there. And if I got seat wet, well it's pouring rain! I could of gotten entire car cleaned for that much. I'm handicapped and on a fixed income. This extra fee causes a hardship and actually takes food from my table. I've used this company for years and have had good and bad but this is robbing me and taking advantage of a trust with my bank info. Company cannot be trusted."
1,"I schedule two Ubers for a trip to the airport for a group of 6. The first Uber arrived and took half of the group. The second Uber was late. As per their policy, I was credited $10 for being late. I could see the Uber coming up the street, then turn around and cancel us. He said he had car trouble. My guess is he had just been notified he lost $10 for running late and decided not to complete the ride. There were no other rides available for more than an hour. We had to drive ourselves and pay for parking for the entire trip, plus pay for the additional Uber which we would not have needed if I knew we were driving ourselves. Uber just sent a canned response/apology. Unacceptable service!"
1,Their price is too high compared to Lyft so I stopped using Uber. I had scheduled times to be picked up early for work and still was late because the app kept switching drivers and I scheduled the ride for the next morning so I had to actually get a Uber a hour before I have to get to work to be there on time.
0,"After an hour of waiting for our food, Uber tracking online said it was delivered but no food. Contacted the restaurant, they said not their problem but did give us the driver mobile number, We rang the driver, and she said that she couldn't find the address so she binned it. Submitted a complaint via Uber forms and no response. We will no longer use Uber Eats... It's a pity because the Uber taxi is a good service but I may need to cancel my account in protest."
0,My elderly mother took ill and was hospitalized. I immediately booked a bus to head to the state she resides as I have moved away. The driver came to my neighborhood. I called to guide him to my home and he cancelled causing me to not be able to make my bus on time and unable to get a refund on my ticket. I am out of $70 bus fare with Uber basically offering no help or a solution. I was unable to spend for another ticket which leaves my mother to go home without care upon her discharge. The driver should be made to pay for my financial loss as people depend on their services. I was given no assistance and told they were unable to do anything about my financial loss.
1,"Sketchy minivan came to pick up my mom and me up in a dark, isolated place where they never would have known there were people waiting for an Uber. A large good looking ** man (about 35-40ish) that had the likeness of an '80s rapper got out of the front seat, sat in the back and motioned for us to get in. The driver, a Pacific Island or Asian descent man (about 40-45ish, or more) who had the likeness of the guy from Fantasy Island looked nothing like the photo of the driver in the app and didn't respond to the mentioned name. Wrong car. Set up like a ride share in the Maryland Baltimore area. Driver not the driver in the photo in the app. Driver did not respond to his name or know my name. What the heck, Uber?!"
1,"I would like for everyone to be safe for the holidays and also I wanted to share my HORRIBLE experience with Uber Atlanta Uber/Lyft Drivers United. So I was headed home from work and I rake a Uber from the train station and the Uber driver got ready turn in the neighborhood. And I told him this is the wrong neighborhood and Uber driver tells me, ""I'm following the GPS"" and proceed to go in the neighborhood and pulls up to a house that was also not mine. I then told him once again this is not where I live. And moral of the story I end up having to walk home and I will no longer be riding with UBER. They are unsafe and drivers don't care about your safe. I have continua to report my issue and they did nothing about us and thought a 5 dollar credit would solve the problem. I am terrified and very scared to after my multiple horrible experiences."
0,Had a Uber car pick my wife and self from 701 S Olive Ave Florida from ride to airport which is 10 minutes away. The fare posted was $7.55. The driver put in a false claim for spilled coffee in back seat. Absolutely false and attempt to claim damages from us. Car was clean when we entered and left. Wasting time having to communicate with Uber.
1,"I have been using Uber for YEARS and use it often, I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on Uber, I am DONE. Uber does not screen their drivers anymore, drivers are rude or don't speak English which is the primary language where I live which makes it hard to communicate if need be, they do not check into the quality of the cars and I know this because I had a friend who has never used Uber sign up to be a driver and was approved after I had been picked up by more than 1 car with no ac and/or had some type of mechanical problem."
1,"When I had to go to work, it showed that the ride would be $8.24. So I agreed, when I finally got in the Uber after waiting for over 20 mins, I seen on my screen that I am being charged 20.41! So I am livid because I did not have 20.41 to have someone drive me 15 mins! The drive took back streets and did not follow the route. I tried calling and emailing Uber with no response. I would like a credit for the amount that was originally appeared on my acct."
1,"Like any business, Uber is all about the money and despite that fact they fail to invest in their technology. My driver drove right past me while I'm waving my arms and kept going. She continued to drive around for 15 minutes instead of going around the block. As a result I missed my bus home for the holidays because she also drove lost and ignored the route that she was supposed to take and it kept rerouting her. Uber's response? Should have canceled when she drove past. Excuse me? Cancel and gets charge her driving and Uber's GPS? I fought back and they said policies and things aren't changing and I don't have to ride with them. Yeah you are right, I don't. Thank you, next."
1,This was the first time that I was using the Uber app. I attempted to set up a pick up for a future date to go to the airport. 5 over drivers showed up. One of them charge me a cancellation fee. One of them charge me for the trip to the airport that I never took. Once I realize that they were showing up I immediately texted the drivers and told them this was a mistake. I wanted it for a future date. They said no problem. However they still showed up and they still charge me. Do not use Uber. They are Crooks. The only reason I gave him one Stars they won't post this review unless you give them some type of rating so I gave them one star even though they deserve nothing.
0,Requested Uber to come to pick me up. The driver never showed up but they charged me cancelation fee! Scumbags! The driver never answered the phone. They just sent me the bill for cancelation! I didn't cancel it! UBER DID but they charged me regardless. AVOID LIKE PLAGUE!
0,"I've read many of the positive reviews and while I have had great drivers with Uber I've also had very bad drivers. It they are bad drivers and you think you can do something to get them removed from Uber think again. That's not going to happen. Probably the worst situation is lack of language skills with Uber drivers around NYC. Here is a case in point. I'm standing in pouring rain. Call an Uber says it will be 5 minutes. 10 minutes later I get a call from the Uber driver in serious broken English which took me about 3 times of asking ""What are you saying?"""
0,After ordering an Uber for a ride to the dealership to pick up my truck the Uber confirmed receipt and was headed to me. The app showed the Uber waiting on me at the pick up but no-one was there except for me. All of a sudden the app showed that the driver cancelled the ride and I was charged 5 dollars. I again ordered another Uber and disputed the charge which they refunded. The second Uber ordered done the exact same thing but I was refused refund. I will never again use Uber and I have downloaded the Lyft app for future use.
0,"We broke down in West Columbia, S.C. and had to get a hotel waiting for repairs. My wife downloaded UBER (we have never used it prior to this). A nice, polite man picked us up promptly and we were very happy with the $10.65 fare. After renting a car and returning home I find all sorts of charges (from Calif.), including one for $6,45 and a $99.99 TIP!~ Of course there is no way to talk to anyone at UBER and so far they have done nothing but ""Promise"" to correct it. We will never use them again and advise others to stay away!"
0,"A little over Two weeks ago, I was a rider in an Uber that go into a car accident when it hit a concrete divider in NYC., myself and my friend were injured and required transportation to the Hospital. We both have several injuries that require medical follow up, my friend suffered from a hairline fracture of her skull and Spin, I have several injuries ranging from concussion to neck injuries as well as knee injuries. My Doctor wants me to get follow up care ASAP but to date Uber has not reached out to use to give us any information. We have tried to contact them multiple times and get a RoBo response that they are taking this issue seriously but nobody has contacted us or given us insurance information. This leaves us in a bind in that we cannot make Dr. apt. without the no-fault insurance information."
1,"My experience with Uber has been terrible. There is no way to actually get in contact with customer service. I lost my phone in the back of one of their cars the other day. The only way to retrieve a lost item is to speak with your driver, however, my driver didn't speak a word of English. So I'm unable to communicate with him. Despite repeated emails to customer service explaining this, all I'm getting back are automatic reply email, telling me to contact the driver. Bad service. Will not use again."
0,"Yesterday I took 2 Uber, like I typically (if not daily) use. On my uber ride home, everything seemed normal. I had a nice chat with my driver as he dropped me off from a 10 min ride. Hours after, I see my Paypal and Credit card statements, and realize Uber has charged me $150 for a ""Cleaning Fee"". They are suggesting that I made a mess to my drivers car. Apparently, the driver sent them a generic picture of a wet at and charge me $150. Mind you, this extra charge/modification was made some hours after my ride was completed."
0,"My driver stole my phone and Uber did nothing about it. I corresponded with their help desk for a week and I only received stock emails. After they were unable to contact the driver, they stop responding to me but they have continued to let him drive under the Uber brand. BEWARE! You may be his next passenger."
0,"Riccardo, Honda Civic, license plate ** in Los Angeles was to pick me up at LAX. Waited only 5 minutes and he texted me to confirm where I was going. He said he would be there in a minute. He pulls up 20 ft from me, and as I walk out from curb he just takes off. I texted him saying, ""Where are you going?"" He said, ""I don't want to take you"" and then charged me a $5 cancellation fee despite he's the one that cancelled it at the last second. Riccardo you're a jerk. Your Uber profile states you drive because ""Need clients to support myself and loved ones."" Such baloney ya loser."
0,"I usually take the bus or train to the airport but Thursday morning Uber Express Pool cost only $5 more than my usual bus or train so I decided to go for that. First thing is that Express Pool seems to make you wait 5 minutes before connecting you with a driver. When it did connect me after 5 minutes it told me to walk a block to a nearby corner and the driver would be there in 4 minutes. 4 minutes became 9 minutes, then 11, then 16 and it became clear from the map that the driver was heading to the airport without me."
0,The Uber driver broke my luggage when he loaded and unloaded it into the trunk. I was trying to put the handle down to separate the luggage and he said he had a better way not separating them. When he took it out at the drop off he handed me a piece that broke and said casually â€œthis came off.â€ The arena to engage the pull up handle release was broken.
0,"Never again will I use Uber. While in Vienna, Austria we took an Uber to the city center from a Marriott. The return trip from the city center was a disaster because the driver (Suzana) took us to the wrong Marriott and would not take us to the correct Marriott. She made all 5 of us leave the vehicle. We are 5 women, all 70 years or older, at 10:30 at night, in a foreign city, in a dark and isolated area. We had to get a taxi to return to the correct Marriott. Personal safety is not a concern to Uber and that in itself is a crime."
1,"I ordered an Uber ride today going from Lafayette Street and Worth Street in lower Manhattan and going to New York Pennsylvania Station. I was instructed to meet the driver at the corner. After waiting for some time my mobile phone alerted me that the driver canceled. I then ordered another car and it said that the car would arrive in 8 minutes. After waiting about 20 minutes there was ""NO CALL and NO SHOW"". I found myself having to take the subway of which I was trying to avoid."
0,"I urge you, do not use Uber. They are well known but as you use them please be sure to look closely at what they are charging and when they are charging. I strongly emphasize on the when. They charged me on a ride I never used even after I said they are not authorized to. I have record of the trip history as canceled just 2 seconds of calling for a ride and they blatantly ignored it. Never addressed that this was an unauthorized charged. 90 days after this trip, I was sent an email 3 days ago from them stating they will charge me because their system made a mistake. Shortly after this, I figured out that their loophole is to close the account 30 days after your trip so you cannot dispute it then send a notification 90 days later saying their system made a mistake to a ride that will be charged 14 days later."
0,"I wouldn't even give this ""company"" one star. First of all, their drivers always cancel my pool trips because they don't want to do pool trips and then I have to deal with the cancel fee and the trip money they take. Apart from dealing with this all the time, about a month ago I was out with a friend and my phone wasn't working so my boyfriend called an Uber for me, about a week later we realized that they had taken $150 out of the account because of some cleaning fee. They sent us a picture that looks like someone spilled water on the door and they said that was the reason. So we told them that I didn't do that and that that could be some random picture taken by their driver and they didn't care. They are not giving me my money back. They didn't even send me an invoice detailing the reason why they were taking that money, I had to ask them. So they basically stole my money. Be careful people. This guys don't care about you, they just want your money. I already deleted my account, I'm riding with Lyft from now on, I've never had a problem with them."
1,"My account was cloned, so I have having money taken out of my account for Uber trips and Uber Eats that I did not make/have.I tried using their Uber_support twitter account, and received the same automated message over and over.I then wrote back, and didn't get a reply. I then replied to my reply, and my issues was apparently taken to the appropriate team. Who then sent me the same automated message.I tried to again explain my concerns, but continued to received the same automated message.The charges still continued to come out of my account. When I messaged them about this, guess what.....THE SAME AUTOMATED MESSAGE.Terrible customer service!! If I could have given 0 stars that's what it would have been."
1,My daughter's Uber account was hacked and you cannot find a single number or chat to have a conversation with Uber directly anywhere. Uber appears unreachable unless you have a safety issue with a driver...otherwise they appear completely unreachable by design.
1,"I was a first time user yesterday, using a Samsung 7 Android and the Uber app, which was set up a week ago, in order to establish an account. It was around 6 pm and needed a ride to the hospital, was attempting to schedule a 6:30 am pickup the following morning. The app appeared to provide a 'Clock' to schedule, which I used, but prior to confirming there was no indication that the time would be 6:30 am. Thinking it was a screen update issue, proceeded and the time reflected 12:50. There is no way to edit, so I cancelled immediately and tried again, paying careful attention and again I ended up with 12:50, so cancelled that and had my Daughter add me to the 'Family' option, which worked out from her end."
1,"Uber has hold the full payment for already cancelled trip. They did not void the payment. Be careful when you used Google Pay to do Uber payments. If we cancel the trip, Uber will hold the full amount. They will not refund it."
1,"I'm going to share a story about why I will never use Uber again. A month ago, my Uber account was hacked. In fact, AMEX confirmed to me that they had SEVERAL people calling in to say their Uber accounts had been hacked that week. Nothing on the media - strange? Within a 4 day window, 118 rides were charged to my credit card in USD - each totaling over $120+ CAD... Resulting in $8,200 of wrongful charges to my AMEX (thankfully I have fraud protection on my CC, so it was on Uber's end to stop the charges). Even though I alerted Uber immediately when it happened, it took them 4 DAYS to STOP the charges from being incurred/charged to my card."
1,"A short while ago my social media was hacked, and it expanded into many of my accounts (Uber being one of them). I then went on to delete my account but Uber has a policy of leaving the account open for 30 days after for possible reactivation. This led to the hacker reopening my account and using my credit card. I have since had to change all my cards. After trying to find a number to call (which they do not offer for riders) I emailed them to try and get my account deleted immediately. After 3-4 emails back and forth with them all they have done is ""refund my money"" (which they said was completed, to a card that is no longer valid) and mark my account for deletion in 30 days (allowing that individual to open my account at their leisure). I would not recommend this service to anyone if they value their privacy."
1,Unfair cancellation fees charged by Uber to customers. Uber is constantly harassing me with wrong cancellation fees for cabs which are getting booked far away from my pickup location where drivers refused to come. So I am charged fees for such situations.
0,"I have been using UberX twice a week, every week since July 2, 2018. On Monday morning I use Uber to go from my house in Mississauga to Pearson Airport, and on Friday early evening I use Uber from Pearson Airport back to my house in Mississauga. Every Monday and Friday exactly at the same time and the same route. Every time Uber charges me different fare, not even two times were the same or even close. Last week they decided to charge me extra money three days after my trip to the airport for unknown and unexplained reason. Uber thinks they can charge you anytime because they have your credit card information. It's completely a rip off and totally inconsistent charges for the same trips at the same time. I decided to cancel my Uber account and use regular taxis or Lyft; no more Uber anymore."
0,"Uber needs to understand that their cab pooling service is very time consuming for passengers. The drivers go even 1-2 kms off destination route to pick up and drop other pool riders. Kindly understand, this is very time consuming and we don't reach our destination early. Not like the fares are super-low that we have to bear this kind of torturous service. It would be awesome if Uber pool services are far more efficient, in the sense, each following pick up should not be of 5-8 mins of difference in terms of distance. In this way, more people will use pool services and add less to traffic jams. Uber should not just focus on making money but also contribute to lesser vehicles on roads which is very necessary in cities like Bangalore which is overflowing with traffic. Kindly do make an impact by bettering pool services and reducing cab fares."
1,Today I booked a ride from I.D.A pharmacy. Driver was waiting in a different lane. When I finally found the car and sat in the car. Driver started arguing with me. He said that he is canceling the ride and I need to book another car. If I got get out of the car he will call the cops. He forced us to come out of the car. He came out of the car and was standing at the door until we came out of the car. How can someone cancel the ride and threaten us like this. Drivers get paid because of customers and this is how drivers behave. This was the worst experience as I was waiting 10 mins and he canceled the ride. Driver's name was Sherif and his cab number was ** Ford Focus. Trip was canceled on 20th oct 2018 at 1.28pm.
0,I joined Uber as prospective rider in case of my car failing and placed money into an account that would be drawn from for each event until expended. I then tried to delete my subscription/acct as an experiment and was told no money would be returned nor sent to a new account once I deleted existing acct.
1,This is the first time I use Uber. I had no clue on how to use the app. Made the mistake of ordering service hours before I needed it. Uber sent two drivers. I was able to get the first before she got to my house and cancel without being charged. The second driver had no phone so I got charged for a canceling fee because he came to my house. There is no number for customers to call for help. All they have for customers is a frigging automated machine. Never using Uber again!!!
0,"Usually I travel to DFW airport daily for my job. Yesterday I rented Uber just as I do everyday. My driver was Glorelys. I am deliberately writing this review in order to educate consumers and since Uber has monopoly is U.S. and they feel nobody or no review can harm their reputation. This, Glorelys was new immigrant from Venezuela. I just don't want to discriminate, but because of my experience I asked her when did she moved to U.S.? She didn't know a single word of English. She was talking in Spanish with me and authorities at the airport. Though I was guiding her on right path, she didn't heed my advice since she didn't understand English. She roamed around airport for 1 hour and Uber charged me $12 more than usual charge. I was late for my job. Instead of giving me refund, it charged more for driver's fault."
1,"After many attempts explaining my situation, it became apparent that Uber has among the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Many contacts with Uber regarding this issue, here was my final attempt to receive fairness from this company. Actually my final attempt was today, Oct. 15, 2018 where I was advised that my claim is too old, their final excuse to keep my money. I began this process within a week of the trip. Here's my story..."
1,"I ordered an Uber and the driver was very nice so I tipped him atter. I kept getting error messages while trying to tip saying that it wasn't going through. I waited a few minutes, tried again, and success. The next day I checked my bank account and saw that I was charged the tip twice. I messaged customer service and they credited the money to my Uber account. I wanted a refund because I rarely use Uber and I just wanted my money because I only authorized a one time tip. After many back and forth messages they still refused to refund my money. I will never use Uber again."
1,"Booked 22 hours in advance no one showed up. Bad as that was, support and help department said: ""We're sorry to hear that your driver canceled your trip and that this delayed getting you to your destination. I can confirm that no cancellation fee was charged on this trip request. If you were referring to a different trip, please let us know."" Well that was nice of them. Then (obviously a form letter since I did not pay anything): ""We understand your concern. We know this is not the news you were hoping to hear, but we will not be able to refund this fare due to it not being within our standards. Thank you."" So, Uber has no policy if no one shows up after an advance booking? Won't be doing that again. Lyft next time."
1,"I would give Ron, uber driver from Sante Fe negative stars if I could. On Oct. 12, 2018 we requested a uber driver to take us from our hotel to Sante Fe airport at 5:30am.The driver showed up, and intrduced himself as Ron. He seemed nice enough. My wife and I got in back, and proceeded to the airport. As we're driving, my wife and I are making small talk with him(where you from, how long you been an uber driver, and so on. Said he was from NY, and had been driving for uber in Sante Fe for 4 years. He started talking about tips, which I thought was very inappropriate. He said he buys water and hand sanitizer for his customers. I said ya, looks like a wet bar back here(lol). His demeanor  quickly changed. He said "" you people are invading my privacy."" HUH! You ""have no bussuiness invading my privacy RIGHT, RIGHT"" (yelling at us) SCARY! We said we're just making small talk as he continued to yell at us. Finally, I told my wife I need to record this. He heard this, pulled over, and told us to get out. It was 5:45am, 40 degrees in an area that was dark no street light or bussinesses miles from our destination.He opened my wives door, and rudely told her to get out. He threw our luggage into the street and drove away. My wife is 65, and has a sling on her arm after a surgery. We didn't know what to do. It was our first uber ride, and I'm pretty sure our last."
1,"First and foremost there is no phone number to contact Uber. Is that legal? Second of all, I have used Uber about 20 times. Great idea but what they do not disclose is that on top of the charge that you pay when you schedule a ride they add an additional charge usually under a dollar. For WHAT? Example: I just scheduled two rides, both for a friend about 30 minutes apart. The first ride was 14.67, the second ride was 15.37. I checked my account and they charged me .40 for no apparent reason and .12 for the second ride. They do not tell you what it is for but it is an unauthorized withdrawal. Pass this information on. How long will customers allow ourselves to be ripped off? It shows how absolutely lazy we have all become to even allow these companies to continue to rob us."
1,"I have a disability which limits my walking. I can't drive due to severe nerve damage and uncontrollable reflexes. The closest store to me is a Family Dollar which is .02 miles from my house. The cost for me to Uber there is $6.50-$7.50. Along with all other companies promising cheaper pricing to make conveniences more affordable is yet another lie. After putting Taxi Cab Services out of business, rates skyrocketed. I can't say how so very disappointed I am with Uber. I have an upcoming surgery which I pray will be a success. I would love to be an advocate for anyone having to utilize transportation services due to no available bus routes so they may travel when needed at a fair price. I use to take Uber to work, the last two years I've paid a private driver to transport me to work, which is cheaper than Uber (12.4) miles 5 days a week. I haven't been able to work in the last 27 days and would appreciate the use of affordable transportation."
1,"Well, I went to Lax from end of the el toro road which it was 54 miles and 1 hour and 8 minutes. When I called Uber to adjust the trip at the first he doesn't accept that and he said everything calculate right but when I prove that I am right he said, ""Yes you are right"" and instead of 50.17mile * 0.87per = 43.45$ 62.32 time * 0.1125= 7.01$. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06$. So 43.45$+7.01$+5.06=(55.72$). But when they make a mistake to calculate the ride and also the support accept that on the recording line. 53.80$Miles * 0.87$ = 46.806 $ 68 minutes * 0.1125$ = 7.65 $. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06 $. So 46.806$ *+ 7.65$ + 5.06$ =59.516 $."
0,"I ordered an UBER by entering the facility name on Monday. There was no issue with arriving time and price, then I confirmed it. However when I arrived there, it was not the one I wanted to go to. I definitely entered the correct facility name and the name of building I arrived was not even same name as I entered. Also I had to add the correct address by myself and they charged me again. I'm sure that the address UBER programmed into their system was wrong and they took me to the wrong place (driver was nice)."
1,"Uber has made transportation much easier, however, it is overrated and expensive. Uber only cares about $ and drivers but does not care about customers at all. First there is not a phone number to reach if you ever encounter any kinds of problems. Only 10% of drivers are actually nice and professional. Uber taking your money when the driver cancels the ride is just ridiculous. Uber should not cut $$ from your account even if you cancel the ride. If our ride cancellations affects the drivers, then Uber should be able to solve that issue for drivers. Customers should not be paying even for a single penny, if they don't use the ride."
1,"Uber drivers made me feel unsafe. I had one Uber driver harass me and kept calling after the fact I cancelled the ride because he had me waiting over half an hour and then called said he drove to wrong place. Most drivers are rude and somehow there's always an issue with the app, then they don't have customer service or a number where someone can be reached if there is an issue. And when I emailed Uber about the driver making me feel unsafe since he kept calling me and harassing me, their only response was to block the driver or call law enforcement. They need to fix the app and thoroughly background check these people they hire!"
0,I had a problem with a driver cancelling and being stranded on the street corner with no ride. I asked support if there was any way to schedule rides so I didn't experience cancellations among other concerns. I got a form letter response saying that the $5.00 I was charged for not getting a ride had been refunded (I already knew that). The email for Uber customer service does not allow for two-way communication. I guess Uber can provide nothing and call it customer service anyway.
0,"I used UBER yesterday for a ride to my home address. After 3 mins in the car, I realized the traffic was too much so I asked the driver to drop me off at the nearest train station instead, which was just 7 minutes away from the spot where he picked me up. My wife booked the UBER thru her phone so I assume the driver would change the drop off location on his phone. An hour later, I receive my Uber receipt for a staggering $60.46!!! I was shocked because according to the receipt, the driver stated that he dropped me off at home which is a lie. I cannot believe they would lie like that and charge me $60.46 for a 7 minute drive. I try contacting Uber four times over this matter but they are not resolving it."
0,"While on vacation in Europe, my wife and I were in an accident in an Uber. It was clearly the Uber driver's fault. Very nice guy, accidents happen. When contacted by Uber they said they would refund our trip, duh. What about the time spent on scene (over an hour), the emotional distress of seeing the other party carted off by ambulance and having been in this traumatic experience. I was just looking for a few credits, not a federal offense. I was told there was no way to determine the amount of compensation for this type of thing. Time to start using Lyft."
0,"I left my iPhone yesterday Oct. 2, 2018 in an Uber. Uber makes it impossible to retrieve item as you can't talk to a live person but must submit via phone (which I left in car) or online only to get a response 24hrs later it's been resolved. I asked for the driver to call me back and got NOTHING. Never ever use Uber again. They exploit their drivers and steal your stuff with no call back. Worst company ever and can't wait for them to fail. All I asked for was a call back from the driver which they promised and never did. Now I have to go back to Vegas without a phone and all my data."
0,Uber is a total rip-off. They scam drivers every day. You always see premium possible for long pickups but never get them. This means it should be a surge because no drivers are in that area. I have copies of all the premium possible trips and never get premium but charge rider a big premium. My last one was a 2.7 mile trip that took 5 minutes. Had to drive 18 minutes to get there and almost 5.5 miles. The rider paid 14.26. I got 5.43 and that included a 1.70 long pickup! Anyone who says they aren't screwing drivers is either an idiot or a troll for Uber! That is criminal. I have pics of every one. What rider would pay 14.26 for a 2.7 mile ride that took five minutes??? Had to be surge! I had to drive 18 minutes and 5.5 miles to get to rider.
1,"I ordered food, and it was supposed to be delivered at 6:55pm. At 7:10 the driver, Tariq, contacted me that he could not found my address (5 min from the restaurant), already on Uber website. I gave him some instructions on how to find it, and he told me I gave the wrong address. Another 10 min and he call again that he was lost. When I try to help him, he told me that he could not waste any more time on my order, because he was losing money every minute. He told me that he was canceling my order. I called the restaurant, reorder the food, and went there to pick up. I was parking on the restaurant when the Uber driver calls again, at 6:40, telling me he was in front my house and I wasn't there to receive my order. I lost it. I told him to feed the food to his dear mother and leave me alone. What a bad experience. I will never order from Uber again."
0,"Venmo sent me an email with a code for $10 off an Uber ride as a celebration for being able to use them as a payment method. I applied the code to my account, took a ride, the code didn't apply. I asked Uber support why and they said I had to make sure payment was on Venmo. Alright. I took another ride and made sure Venmo was my payment, still nothing. Contacted Uber support over 7 times and got answers ranging from, ""we don't know what ride you're talkkng about"", to ""select your payment method to apply credit"" to ""This code expired"", ""We're unable to refund or credit this ride"". Basically, they refuse the email fine print from Venmo and don't care that there was a promo code that was supposed to work on their platform. Very poor service."
1,I was quoted $6.25 for my ride and charged that. Hours after my drop off I received multiple notifications of a charge of $16.14 and $9.87 being charged to my card for my one ride. Yes 3 separate charges for one Uber express pool ride. I immediately filed a complaint which really only wasted my time and pissed me off even more. I was bounced from rep to rep and had to restate the same information over and over and OVER again. The last rep made it seem like she had resolved the issue until today when I saw a pending charge of $16.14 on my company card which is linked to my Uber account for business travel.
1,"9/30/2018 Arizona Cardinals game. Request Uber driver, app says driver will arrive in 11 minutes. 30+ minutes go by, driver doesn't show up. I call the driver, he says he is on his way, 2 minutes later, driver cancels on me. Without my permission, Uber says they are finding another driver. Another 30 minutes goes by, driver calls and says he came and didn't see me and left. Said he'd come back. I watch, 2 minutes later that driver cancels on me. I wasted 1 hour in the parking lot waiting for two drivers who cancelled on me."
0,"Today I left my cell phone in the Uber. Every avenue I have taken to try to contact Uber has led to a dead end. I need the verification code sent to my phone in order to login from my desktop. But I do not have my phone. So I cannot get the verification code. There is a page purportedly just for resolving this issue. But it no longer works. I emailed customer service for help getting into my account and at 12 hours later, I have not had a response. I emailed them all day, actually. I called the only number available. That number is for drivers. There are no telephone numbers for riders unless you have the app on your phone. But I don't have my phone. The lady on the driver line promised to help me, then she put me on hold for 40 minutes. So I finally hung up. While I was on the driver line, I heard all the things Uber is doing for their drivers, as a ""driver centric company."" They do not care about the consumer at all. This is wrong. Just plain wrong."
1,"I took an Uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car. I contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app. He confirmed he had the cardigan. He said when he is back in my area he would drop it off. I did not hear back for a while so contacted him again. He said he would drop it off to me but I'd have to pay almost £45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the Uber offices in Canary Wharf. I then asked he drops it off at Canary wharf. I also asked that he let me know the details I will need to collect the item. My fare to the hospital was £7 by the way. Anyway, the driver whose uber user name is ""Abobacar"" stopped responding to me. I contacted Uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail. So I suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so there's nothing they can do. I filed a Police report and the Police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf. I relayed the message to Uber but they declined. A few weeks after, Abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing. So I asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item, they did not respond to that. The moral of the story is, if you have a problem with an Uber driver Uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it. They appear to have a finders keepers policy. It is disgraceful. I still use Uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as I get a chance to find one. Also, I will send an invoice to Uber as advised by the police. I will follow up with feedback at a later date. Beware of ""ABOBACAR"" the Uber driver!"
1,"I have been driving for Uber for about 6 months now, and they are horrible. When I try and cash out on fast pay it's always something going on with their site. I really hate that when you call them nobody knows nothing. I sit online with Uber for over an hour and nobody even came back to the line. This company needs to be close because they are inconsistent and does nothing for no one other than Uber. I would not recommend them to nobody not even my damn dog."
0,"I booked my Uber cab from Cantonment railway station to Bengaluru airport. After my ride gets started, my driver received a call from other customer for pickup. Suddenly my driver asked me to get down and book for a another cab. I ignored him and asked for the reason. Then I come to know that he is working for both OLA and UBER. The 2nd customer is from OLA request. I confirmed this from OTP option asked before started ride. Then I requested the customer to drop me first as I am already delay to my flight. Finally the driver not dropped me in the actual destination... hence I missed my flight... At last my important official meeting got canceled because of me. I am demanding from UBER at least to refund my missed flight charge 3500/-. I am not getting proper response... Feeling very bad about this... Need justice else will go to any extend to get back my loss."
1,"I was exceptionally satisfied with Uber until yesterday. On reaching my location, my app showed a payment amount. The Uber driver requested a higher amount than the app request. I paid what the app showed, and the cash function on my account was revoked. Follow up customer service? Was shocking despite me using the service daily. Wrong platform to answer the query, electronic response. Nobody can or will assist with a genuine query. I've installed Taxify."
1,"I have never had an issue with Uber in the last two years of using their service until two days ago, when I scheduled a ride the night before. Upon entering the details, a window popped up on the app indicating a Pick Up guarantee. If the driver did not show up within the window of time allotted, the passenger would be credited $10 for a future ride so long as it met the eligibility criteria. My driver exceeded the window of time and arrived later. As a result, I was late to arrive for my appointment. I wrote to customer service and requested the credit. The rep stated they would credit $5 instead. When I quoted their policy verbatim, the second rep stated they would not be paying any additional credit. 24 hours later, they still haven't even credited the $5. It's annoying that as a loyal user with a pretty good rating can't even get something like this resolved, and in line with Uber's policy."
0,"No problems with the riders. Uber app charged the incorrect card at the end of the ride, despite profile setup. No big deal here. I requested the charge to be switched to the other in the account and they could not make this basic transaction in more than 10 days I left the ticket open. My periodic follow-ups were useful only to be told that a specialized team was looking into it. I never asked for troubleshooting details but only for the charge to be switched between the cards registered in the account. Customer service just bounced me back every time with no excuse, given the type of request. I could not add that ride to my expense report in time to be reimbursed by my company as it was a business trip. Thanks Uber for that!"
1,"Worst case scenario with Uber is that they don't have customer care number available in India. I paid twice for a ride as I have booked a ride and paid via my debit card and transaction had done but Uber shows me an outstanding payment of my ride and when contacting them via email they response very slow. Plus when I finally got a call from them they said, ""We have blocked your card and to remove that send us the transaction script"" and even after sending them they said that it's not proper and after sending them one after another mail but still I don't get any reply. I am very much sure that Uber should be banned in India till they got a customer care office in India."
1,As Uber driver in North California. This is second time happen to me in within six months. I got a text message from Uber says they identified improper use of the app as a result they remove my promotion from my earning period and will deactivate my account if similar problem occur again. I talk to support customer service. They send my case to an expert and after waiting for 36 hour for their reply and demand them to explain to me what mistake I have done in order to avoid doing it again because I really care about my job as Uber driver. They seem to be careless and sent me same message. They send earlier like robot message.
1,Uber driver stopped then drove off without explanation and cancelled my trip once he saw my grandmother was in a wheelchair. When making a complaint they said they would look into it but could not tell me the outcome. Disgraceful company.
1,"I book cabs through Uber app a lot many times. Some experiences was good some was bad but my recent experience with Uber was just nuisance. I have to take my sister to the hospital as she was not feeling well in the evening, so I booked a cab via uber. The distance was hardly 3-5 km from my pick up location to my destination. First it took 10-15 mins to connect me with one driver when my pick up point is very near to the main highway (less than even 1 km). And 10 around cabs are always available in this area."
1,I was given a fare of 6.31. I was billed 26.31. After I reviewed my trip my destination address totally wrong. I have been writing back and forth with them for 2 days. Now they cannot seem to get it right. I was wrongly charged again after their review. Was given a partial refund. Then they wrote me saying I will get the rest. I am still waiting. This is just a unneeded pain in the **. Horrible cust service. I will be trying Lyft.
0,"Customer service on the part of Uber completely sucks. Had problems requesting a ride twice that system errored, got locked out of my account because of your errors. Went through help to unlock it and it errored twice. Again same EXACT problem. Tried help again. ZERO response from customer service the second time even after following your prompts online. Bad for business when people are trying to use the service first time on vacation. Ended up having to use taxi service. It's over 12 hours later and STILL no response from Uber. Hope they end up out of business. Will certainly be reporting poor ratings anywhere & everywhere I can including BBB & state attorney general."
1,"Uber Support in USA is basically bunch of
incompetent idiots. They are polite, and that is only positive thing one can
say. But they have no clue about anything, totally useless and waste of time. My experience: I was having problem with uploading documents
and updating account. (I uploaded documents, but it was not getting approved even though everything was in order). I called Uber support *******069-   First time I called, they reviewed documents, told me everything
is fine and it will be approved within 2 hours-  Next day I called again (as it was not approved) , they
reviewed documents, told me everything is fine and it will be approved within 24
hours-  It was not approved so I called third day, now they told me they can not approve it and I need to go to Greenlight hub  in Toronto, to submit documents there , do
(again) background check (even though nowhere on web site was asking for it) -   I did go to Greenlight hub  in Toronto 9 days ago. They were fast, professional took my documents, updated it, did a  background check and said it will be 5
days to get results but after that it is all good and I should be able to continue
driving with no problem-   (because you can not phone to Greenlight hub  in Toronto)  I called Uber support today hoping to be able to verify simple thing : Did they get results of background hack and if everything is okay.  Incompetent loser on
the other side took a time to ""check"" and then said background check is okay
but he kept repeating like a parrot "" we are in process of reviewing and it
might take 7-15 business days"" .  What are they reviewing  he was not able to explain.Conclusion: calling Uber support is total waste of time, they are useless bunch of morons"
1,"As a rider all is somehow ok but as a driver this company is the biggest scam ever... They will use you, abuse you and throw you like a piece of trash after you get just a couple of traffic tickets, claiming on your driving record that even the non moving violations are moving violations for them... This nasty company full of thieves will steal drivers' tips and tolls and squeeze out of you and your car all they can before kicking you away..."
1,"In June, I ordered an Uber car to pick someone up at Marseilles Train Station and bring them to an address that was one hour away. The screenshot of their quote showed that the cost would be between 192 and 254 Euros. There was absolutely no mention of a surcharge. They then charged me 471.02 Euros ($742.47 CA) saying the ride was at a high traffic time. It was 10:30 pm at an almost deserted train station."
1,"While traveling Europe I spent over 500 Euro with Uber. They overcharged me on 25% of the trips I made compared to the quoted price given on phone app, after the ride was completed. One instance they quoted me 40 to 50 Euro and charged me 70 Euro! Over a 100 Euros were spent from overcharges compared to their quoted phone app price. This seems very dishonest to me."
1,A promotion was offered in my area to sign up as a driver for uber 200 dollars extra if 100 rides were completed in a month... I completed 100 rides in 10 daysbut never recieved my bonus... So i called uber driver support... Who hung up on me 3 times then transfered me arround their office as i asked to speak to their managers... With them all saying i never opted into that bonus program so i wouldnt be getting it... After i asked to speak to a manager for the third time the male i was speaking to said he was the highest up in management and that he had herd my problem amd wouldnt be doong a thing about it and that he didnt have any more time to spend on the phone with me and he hung up again....   Here i come lyft.... No wonder there arnt enough uber drivers... Now there is one more less.
1,"I have been unable to use my uber account for over a week, they cannot send a verification code to my phone, i tried a friends number, still not working, I called my provider, SMS messages are permitted, an after 16 emails to uber m they are still telling me they have a new team working on it and will resolve it, I have asked them to call me several time as  they have numbers on their site   that are definitely not uber.  I cannot believe such a company gets away with this , they do not deserve business, I feel bad for their employees, I will be usong Lyft from now on!!"
0,"I have attempted to set up Uber on my phone for a month now. It kept saying that my number was already registered. After multiple emails to the company explaining that I have not register my number and sending all the information they requested it never got resolved. It is a waste of time, useless customer service."
1,"Humble, Texas. September 15, 2018, I ordered a ride and was picked up by Edwin, driving a Toyota Corolla. The ride was quoted as $11.45. Later that evening, I tried to order another ride and received a message that I owed $35.00 for the previous trip. I requested a review of the fare, because the morning ride is a regular ride to Dialysis, 3 days a week and $11.45 is in the normal range. I received a message today stating that the driver reported a mess made and I was provided with 2 pictures...there is no mess shown and I know a mess was not made because I didn't have anything to make a mess with."
0,My issue with Uber is they quote you a price when you complete your trip and days later the price is different. They don't tell you anything. I started using one card just for them that is how I found out and if you check your receipt it's says wait time or toll surcharge and fees. This is robbery and they need to stop. The drivers are saying they arrive and most of the time they are in the wrong place or they drop you off in the wrong place and pretend they did not hear you say no it's over there. That's stealing.
1,"Spent way too much time today setting up our Uber for Business account since several folks from our company are going to be traveling. Sounded like a great concept but after getting everything set up I was informed that they needed three days to process our account. Nowhere was there a mention of that and we've used Uber individually for a long time. So, tried to get some help and they just weren't too concerned or interested in trying to resolve the issue. So account is deactivated and we use another provider who seems to care a lot more about customer service. Just a warning..."
1,"Since February of 2016, I've been using Uber on behalf of the company I work for to schedule rides for our clients coming into town. I've probably spent close to $1500 in gift cards alone since then. I've never had a problem until yesterday. After two company cards, a PayPal account, and multiple attempts to pay through the app and the Mac, I could not get their system to accept a payment. I confirmed with my bank, that the issue is not the card. In fact, the bank is holding these transactions. But Uber doesn't have a record of them."
1,My account was hacked and the hacker did rides fraud and charged 800 soles and Uber when I reported charged it too. My credit card 800 soles and after all the proof provided by me they agreed to give the money back and they mistakenly send it some unknown account not owned by me even though I reminded them my right account and now when I updated all my information they asked for dragging for 2 months and now when I was upset they decided not to return my money and block my account. Great way of robbing.
0,"I tried to add my daughter to my Uber account and ran into numerous problems. I am in CROYDON, PA and my daughter is in Philadelphia PA. My daughter needs the Uber getting back and forth to work. We have messages that the payment needed changed, invalid payment method. There is no customer service # to call so I am dealing with a friggin robot. Robot says they lifted restrictions off my account. My daughter tries to use Uber again and gets a, ""Oops something went wrong!"" Only good part is I can curse out the robot and not get hung up on. Uber needs a customer service representatives, not robots to have any satisfied customers! Uber is a big joke!"
0,"I had booked a ride to take us from a restaurant on Canal Street, to the West Village. The driver stopped at the wrong place. We signaled him NOT to make a U turn on a busy street: we'd cross with the light. We did. He charged us for waiting time. Then he took the wrong route, and we wound up in New Jersey. We told him he had the wrong route, and he screamed ""I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING."" In Jersey City, there was an accident in front of us - a bad one. He swerved, and nearly started a second one. Then he told us ""as a courtesy"" he wouldn't charge the NJ surcharge. After we got back to NY (another ""courtesy"", he wouldn't charge us the toll), he started taking us to Brooklyn. Twice. Again 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING'. Two sixty year olds have to act like James Bond and jump out of the car when it stops, to get away. We were further downtown than when we started. Uber's reaction? ""Oh well, we refunded your fare."""
1,"Took a Uber ride about 8 minutes. The driver was Spanish. 3 hours later get email Uber takes $80 out of my Visa card. Apparently driver says 3 hours later I did damage. This is Uber's cleaning fee then I find out the driver was suppose to be a ** but I called, filed complaint but this is a scam all over Uber."
1,"They have little to no  customer service. They have no actual person that you can speak to. They make it almost impossible. I have tried to explain to them in many different ways that they have charged me double for every trip that I have taken, and charged me double the tip for every trip that I have taken, and the money has come out of my bank account, but they still keep telling me that I have an outstanding balance and That I must pay it again!"
1,"Car number plate: GFI4CZKThis may not reflect the whole of UBER, however, as my first and subsequentially last UBER ride, I think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again. First, he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage (literally 4 shopping bags), despite it fitting with an excess of room, then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount. Rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company. Would recommend UBER to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we, as customers, do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day. It may be amazing in the US but in the UK you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service. If you use UBER and get this number plate, then save yourself the bother and find another car."
0,I've driven for Uber for 3 years and constant battle for them to get fares accurate or my rides disappear completely. And it's always in their favor. And always the bigger fares. I've never been overpaid for a ride accidentally. Customer service is a joke. They act like idiots who can't understand common English and only ever send a canned response. It is the most frustrating customer services I've ever dealt with. Uber treats drivers as though they are expendable. When they list how many miles I drove on a ride it is always less than that what I actually drove according to my GPS.
1,"Uber is continually squeezing profit away from drivers by changing their policies. I've been driving for over a year and have a nearly perfect rating. I do a fantastic job for this company and I feel completely unappreciated. I am not alone. Every month that goes by, Uber finds ways to change their policies to be less friendly to drivers, who they call partners. They have made it clear to me more than once that I am expendable. Regardless of the service that I provide for them, they are aware that hundreds of other drivers signed up today, and if I don't like it I can leave. They're changing incentives that we have counted on and taking up to two-thirds profit in many rides. Uber needs to be held accountable and must show their appreciation and value of the drivers who are the backbone of their business."
0,"Requested an Uber from hotel on the beach to the airport, about a 45 minute drive. While I was waiting I noticed a car similar to the one I was expecting pull up and three people jumped in. Waited a little longer and then noticed that I was on my way. Someone else had taken my ride. To add insult to injury I couldn't request another Uber until that ride was done, and I got charged for it! No response as yet from Uber, I wonder how long it takes for them to respond. The driver obviously didn't verify who he picked up."
0,"Driver took me to wrong destination - claiming I had entered the wrong address. I typed the address into the app, but it defaulted to another address (thanks, Uber). I paid about $12 extra and 15-20 extra minutes to get to the right place. I hate Uber. They just don't get it. LESSON LEARNED: When getting into the car, BE SURE TO CONFIRM your desired destination by exact street address with the driver. Uber's drivers simply follow the GPS in the app and won't ask to confirm. Uber's drivers are stupid automatons. No wonder Uber is on forefront of developing driverless technology... they are practically there already. The Uber app will offer several alternate destinations as you type in the destination address. If you, by chance, tap the wrong one - and don't notice - you'll wind up on wrong side of town. Uber accepts no responsibility. Be careful using its app. Be careful with Uber. They rip you off and you have no recourse."
0,"As a former UberEats driver this company has HORRIBLE customer service and most of the representatives cannot comprehend English. They take you around and around asking you the same questions over and over again and they have no respect for the drivers, though they love issuing apologies without solving your issues. They have constant issues with their app and as an UberEats driver your trips REGULARLY go missing and you have to fight tooth and nail for your missing money, IF they even solve it. It sucks when your trips go missing because you then lack proof of the delivery unless you screenshot your trip (which is ridiculous to have to remember to do for every trip) which makes speaking with their unprofessional representatives even more difficult. "
0,I got this guy and he charged me and never came. He blamed the GPS when I gave him clear directions then when he finally saw us he drove off and canceled the ride charging me $13 and still charged me plus a $5 fee for driving around. What a scum bag. Spread the word so people know. I don't want this happening to other people I want you all to be aware of what some Uber driver are doing. Be careful and always check your online receipt because they are ripping people off???
1,"I linked my credit card to Uber for Epayment purpose but after my travel on 09/08/2018 Driver ask me to pay and I told him I linked my card. It will deduct from my card and driver said that, â€œI am not received money. Please pay cash,â€ hence I paid cash. Now again they deduct from my card also. When I contact help center of Uber they told that cash exchanged outside the Uber system cannot be recorded hence we cannot take account and cannot adjustment are refund."
0,"I ordered a Uber for work 8/28/18. They then sent me the text message saying he would be there in 5 mins. I continued to get dress. Not even a minute after that message came thru it said he was here... so I quickly called the number it gave me and asked him politely for 5 mins. He said ok. I told him where to park. I run out 4 mins later and there is nobody there and It says I canceled the order. I then had it reordered for me receiving the same driver Richard Kia Soul **. It sent me the same message saying 5 mins. I decided not to take the chances and sat outside waiting for him for about 7 mins. When nobody showed up I tried the contact number, took me to the voice over thing. When I checked to see where he was it said I canceled again. Now tell me why would I recancel an order I deliberately just redid?? And when I contact customer service thru the app like it says they don't care!!"
1,Uber is fine unless you're trying to cancel a trip. I accidentally booked a trip. I contacted the driver and immediately within 30 seconds and he did not cancel it. I responded again 5 minutes later. The driver did not cancel. He finally told me to cancel after he arrived at my destination. The issue I have is that there's no cancellation button. I was scrolling through every area of the Uber app trying to figure out how to cancel this ride even after I contacted the driver and I could not locate anything. Upon intensive internet search trying to find an 800 number to call Uber directly and being unsuccessful I finally did an online search and was told thru a wiki article how to cancel a trip... to click on a tiny picture of the driver to access the cancel button. This is deceptive practice. I was charged $13.37 because of the driver's time because he did not cancel the ride and I had no idea or information on how to cancel it myself.
1,I have seen the Uber commercial where they claim to do background checks for the safety of their riders. Well I had an incident in 2011 and they hired me in 2017 let me setup my life to drive and support my child and wife and out of nowhere ran a background check and closed my account and I have a 5 star rating and I just think this is unfair and they should have taking care of this before they hired me.
1,"My husband and I went to the Taylor Swift concert in Nashville TN last night, August 25, 2018. Our Uber experiences have always been great until early this morning when trying to get back to our hotel. I don't understand how it cost roughly $26 to get from our hotel to the Nissan Stadium and $185 to get back to our hotel after the show. That is price gouging and it's illegal! We paid it to get back to our hotel because that was our only option, but that kind of money is needed for the house payment! I am extremely disappointed in Uber! I understand the demand for a ride was high, however 5.7 times higher is unacceptable!"
1,"I'm trying to dispute an Uber cancellation fee, and it's apparently impossible to do so on the website. You're told to click the arrow twice and select Problem with Cancellation Fee, but that's not findable. I'm bothered because I was at the location, having booked it just inside the building entrance and then having sat on a bench in front. The driver never called me, which he/she should have done if there was any confusion about the pickup point; I rebooked and connected with the new driver at the same location. Very poor service, I'm heading for Lyft from now on."
0,"My name is Clarence **, I was currently a full time Uber driver, Uber decided to deactivate my account which was my bread & butter for more than 13 months straight, I have a 4.90 Uber rating and I have drove more than 4800+ folks with awesome compliments, my bills which included car payment and insurance, rent and etc. My car that I financed a year ago was strictly for Uber, now I'm on the edge of losing my car and other things that matter. Please can someone help me as Uber has deactivated my account for a annual background check, I've been working for Uber for over a year and I have passed the requirements to become a Uber driver, so my question to Uber is why? Why me? And I've still haven't gotten a good response and I've been telling them about my bills and situation and they seem not to care."
0,"Beware, when you choose Uber Express Pool because they tell you to go far to meet the driver, and the driver never lets you know he is there. They only give 2 minutes of waiting time. And then the Uber charge you a fee of $6.00 which is more than the cost of the trip. It is a scam."
1,"I've decided to write a review only after a second experience of this kind. I will continue to keep close tabs on all Uber charges from now on. The fÃ¬rst time I was charged for a round trip to and from airport at the next pay level up (limo level). Uber was adamant about the charge along with the driver, despite the verifiable fact that had I actually made the trip reported, I wouldn't have landed in another city which happened to be 2 hours away by plane. This was 3 hours after I arrived at airport. The other issue verifiable by Uber's hold on my credit card for the correct amount. Price was double the authorized charge."
0,"So I scheduled at 4:15 to 4:25am pick-up from Uber to go to airport. Uber driver notified at 3:50am and dispatched to my house. Driver leaves before my pick-up window, does not tell me he is waiting (neither does App) and I get charged a cancellation fee. I try a second time to locate a driver on Uber but none available and a driver also not available on Lyft. I end up with a taxi and a hefty fare charge. Uber touts that they offer a guarantee that your driver will be there during your pick-up time or they will give you a $10 credit. It took two e-mails to get Uber to reverse the cancellation fee, this happened only after they admitted that their driver left early. Poor, poor driver service and customer service. If Uber will not stand behind their guarantee then how can you trust them to pick you up on your scheduled time? I only ask for accountability and dependable service, isn't this what we are paying for..."
1,"I have used Uber twice and received good service. The drivers were prompt and polite and UBER billed me correctly and efficiently. However, today I had a bad experience. I contacted Uber. I was told the driver was 3 minutes away at a nearby market, which is about 3 minutes from my home. I waited 10 minutes and the driver was still 3 minutes away at the same market. I waited 15 minutes, then I texted the driver to tell them that since they didn't show, I wanted a credit. I had to get a ride from someone else since I was already late for my appointment."
1,Uber is one of the worst cab provider... every time I face some problem... last time was driver did not come even after several phone calls and finally I had to pay phenality for that... I simply deleted the app
0,"For two+ years I have asked Uber to reimburse me for daily, weekly, monthly and annual services not received by me. None of the formal complaint files provided by Uber address such matters that are routinely provided by virtually all other Business."
0,"The driver has submitted a claim for $150 through the app. After calling him through the Lost Item option on the app and confronting him about it, he claims he has no idea what I'm talking about and that he's ""too busy"" for this. His claims are false and fraudulent, and I will NOT be held liable for a fraudulent scam. I will be reporting this company and your driver to the police for fraud. I will also report you to the Better Business Bureau and raise hell on any and every social media site known to mankind."
1,"Whenever I book a bike or cab from Uber they never came in location from which I have booked the cab. They always go somewhere else, the problem with uber is picking up the location. Its app picks up the wrong location and the drivers goes somewhere else, then I need to help drivers to get my location. So here is the incident: yesterday (10 Aug 2018) I booked a Uber bike and I put my drop location, the same location I always puts whether it's uber or Ola and before reaching the exact location the driver says, ""This is the location you have put and I will not go beyond this location,"" I told him that, ""You will need to go from another side. This street is closed to get my place,"" he denied to go. I told him, ""If you drop me on my location then you will be paid otherwise no payment."""
0,"I tried to schedule a trip for Sunday.  When I went into the app to schedule a ride, it immediately dispatched a driver.  I pressed cancel on the app several times with no results.  I then saw who the driver was and called her.  She thanked me and didn't come.  5 minutes later, another Uber driver came.  He cancelled the trip after hearing my issue asking that the customer not be charged.  Two minutes later another driver came.  I then was charged a cancellation fee."
0,Tried driving for them going on two weeks still waiting on the decal I ordered twice.  By time it comes I won't be trying to drive for them.  Guess it's better then a two week wait from lyft on a background check. Not worth it. Y time you get everything it's the same as waiting 2-3 weeks at a new job for a paycheck.
0,I ordered an Uber and the driver picked up the wrong riders. I contacted Uber and received a notification that I would receive a refund and they never gave me my refund and no one has gotten back to me no matter how many times I have contacted them. They acknowledged that someone else took my ride but still didn't refund the money. Horrible customer service. Or lack there of.
0,"I'm really disappointed with Uber for what I feel was â€œpointing of a gun at my face and rip me offâ€ at the very last minute when I needed the service the most. I had book a trip from Madrid to the Airport, I was showed a fare from low to high, I was ok with it, I ordered the service. Less than 10 minutes before my trip, I received a message from Uber saying that due to congestion and demand (6AM and Madrid was empty), I will be charge 50% or more. I received this message and at the same time the confirmation that the driver was on its way."
0,"Beware. This company allows drivers to submit fake pictures claiming you made a mess of their cars and will charge you up to $150 extra without even giving you the common decency of a phone call. I was hit with a totally false charge and Uber initially refused to refund me. I did absolutely nothing to the driver or his vehicle yet when this claim hit my email, because Uber does absolutely nothing over the phone, they had already charged me without hearing my side for any details. Please avoid this alleged criminally designed company. They are not worth the headache and definitely not worth your hard earned money."
0,I have never experienced a worse service experience than I have had with UBER both here in the US and on my recent trip to the UK. I don't understand how a company can be allowed to do business when it treats their customers the way I was treated. I got a promotional code from Citibank AAdvantage credit card services to use a promo code so I can get credit on my first 2 rides with Uber. I had never used Uber before so I downloaded the App and proceeded to put in the promo code. I kept on getting error messages so I tried to get a customer service phone number in the US. To my surprise a company as big as Uber does not offer any phone customer service in the US. A multibillion dollar company with NO PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
1,It's been 6 months for today. I had recharged for 1000 on Jan 31st 2018. I see that in my payment there is a balance of only 650 Rs. When I started querying Uber on my 350 Rs till date these shameless guys haven't turned up to me with a valid justification as in where that money went.
1,"I do really appreciate the value of the Uber Pool. You can't beat the cost. Drivers are typically very friendly, but the GPS they use is terrible. I usually have to direct them because the GPS is so lacking."
1,Uber is helpful to get around as we do not live near a city bus. We can open the app and see how long a ride will take. This helps the teens and seniors in our family when I am at work. It is competitive and cheaper than a taxi.
1,"I had left my phone in an Uber car whilst away on business in San Jose in April, I am yet to have a satisfactory conclusion to my dispute. I went to my hotel room and got my tablet device and went to the Uber website and logged in however, couldn't do anything without an SMS verification which would be sent to my phone which was in the car, so pointless. I downloaded the Uber app on device but couldn't operate anything there. I even logged onto Samsung website and attempted to force my phone to ring but it was out of power. The only way I could get hold of Uber was by writing on Twitter at how bad my experience was and they asked me to private message. I then explained where I went from and to and the times and took a snapshot of the email receipt for the trip. "
1,"I was very happy with Uber until my last experience when I had a ride with Uber to Kashmiri gate. When I booked the ride I was shown 188/- for my ride. As soon as driver arrived he said it is 285/- fare showing on his app. I thought it will be updated. At the end of the ride driver asked me to pay the amount showing on his app. I showed him it is 188 on my end. He said, â€œYou can escalate it later with Uber. Right now you will have to pay 285/â€. I paid it, also the receipt I got from Uber is still showing 188."
0,I love using Uber. Sometimes the price is higher than the cab service and that sucks. If they were a bit cheaper I would use Uber all the time!
1,"I've use Uber for the last 2 years and never complained about anything even when I had small issues. Today I've tried to talk to a human being for the last 4 hours and there is NONE existence!! The automated stupid robot keeps emailing be nonsense - I asked for A ride at 4:30 am and it said driver is 9 min away for $35 rate - after 30 minutes I saw on the app that the driver is struggling to find the place - I called, texted and no response. Finally he canceled. Second driver showed 7 min away with the same rate. The same exact thing except this one the driver at least called. Trust me I don't live in a desert. I've had many rides on the same location."
0,Both drivers were early and courteous. They were both efficient drivers and got us to our destination on time. The only objection was their route of travel. Since it was our first experience we did not know we could have told them there was a faster more direct route to our destination.
0,"7/29/2018
Have you as a driver tried to get app support when urgently needed.....forget it!!!!
At least lyft has phone support that can be accessed within minutes."
1,"I was charged $80 for a 10 minute drive which would have cost me no more than $30 by taxi. 
I will not use uber anymore."
0,Used Uber when we were attending a wedding in CA and they were prompt and the driver was good. Driving on CA highways can be stressful but the driver knew where he was going.
0,"I ordered an Uber around 1130pm on July 20, 2018 for a 4.6 mile drive that would normally take 10 minutes. The regular car said it would cost almost $17 and the rideshare option was between $11-12. I opted for the cheaper option to save some money. The app told me the driver would arrive in 5 minutes, I waited in excess of that for the driver, fine. I get in the vehicle and settle in to look at my phone to see the fare jumped to $14.06. I agreed to one fare and Uber charged me over the agreed upon fare. Not to mention the driver drove so slow as if he was waiting for another pickup along route. I arrived to my destination much later than expected. He would stop at stop signs and wait half a minute before moving, it was past midnight at this point and there was nobody on the road. He also drove a route that was slightly longer than another."
0,The only problem I ever had was at Las Vegas airport at passenger pick up. I had to wait almost an hour and had to cancel twice before a driver actually showed they were going to airport. All other places were good.
1,"Was a little nervous to use but after I did, I found that I felt very safe each time, very polite drivers, clean cars and felt very comfortable. I was impressed."
1,"It has been over THREE weeks now and I have been told several different times by the Uber support team members that someone from their insurance adjuster's office will contact me within 2-3 business days. 
This has yet to happen. My shoulder is still in severe pain and I do not have insurance to have it looked at.
They just keep ignoring me.ORIGINAL MESSAGE TO UBER SUPPORT""
Hello, I was picked up yesterday (06/27/2018) at 12:04 in front of the *** in Colorado Springs, CO.
I wanted to bring to your attention something that happened concerning this ride. The driver was great and got me to my job interview on time! However, when he picked me up, I had my backpack and duffel bag with me because I didn't have time to take it to my storage unit first.
Well, he drove a **** which is a very large truck. As I approached the truck he rolled down the window and said that I can just put my stuff in the back of the truck. So I walked around to the passenger side and proceeded to do so. The duffel back was extremely heavy and I had to lift it up to my head and lean over holding it up just to get it into the back of the truck.
Lowering the duffel bag in, I got an extremely sharp pain in my left shoulder like something tore--it knocked the air out of me. I squeezed my shoulder and tried to catch my breath. Then I placed my backpack into the back of the truck and got inside and we left. I was running late to my job interview so that was my only concern at that moment.
I think the driver noticed what happened because once he dropped me off, he quickly jumped out of the truck and replied: ""here, let me get that bag for you.""
Anyways, I thought it was just a minor injury and that it would be fine by the next morning. Sadly, that is not the case.
I was up most of the night because I couldn't sleep on my left side at all and anytime that I turned on my side the pain woke me up. I can no longer lift my left arm above my head or reach for anything without screaming in pain.
Because of this, I am terrified that this is going to interfere with any possible job duties, if hired, and/or prevent me from passing any physicals should any job require one.
I am writing you this because I just can't stop worrying how this is going to affect me. I'm homeless and I need to work and it terrifies me that this is going to prevent that from happening.
""This is the same blanket email that I get from Uber every time I ask them why no one is contacting me:
""...an insurance adjuster will contact you in 2-3 business days to discuss the details and claims process... Thank you for your patients.""Now, it has been nearly a month and the pain is only getting worse. Uber just keeps blowing me off hoping that I will just go away. Well, if this pain would go away then so would I!"
1,"I've only used Uber once but I had a good experience. They arrived on time, took the shortest route and got me to my destination. He was very pleasant and friendly."
1,"The service is great! I trust my children riding with Uber. And the benefit to the community is not measurable, I'm confident the service has saved many accidents and damages to persons and property."
0,"I like Uber for the most part. Their prices fluctuate (increase) frequently. There is no phone number or email to get in touch with Corporate. You get charged when the drivers go to the wrong place and say you aren't there. You get charged when you cancel but you don't get anything when drivers don't show and there is no way to make this known. For the most part it is ok but, these are things that have happened to me or family or people I know."
1,"Uber is easier to use than a taxi. Instead of trying to find a cab, I just ordered a Uber from my phone and the driver found me. The car was clean and the driver was courteous."
0,I am very impressed with the overall concept of the Uber and the dependability of service. Drivers are personable but not overbearing; courteous and intuitive - every customer does not always want to interact or converse.
1,"I have used Uber since they came to my area. The prices have skyrocketed since they first began service here. The last two times I used it, the driver was lost and driving around forever so the wait was extremely long. Besides the price hikes, I really like Uber."
1,"Contacted Uber via Phone app for services from address used on multiple occasions. Uber provided four locations for me to travel to be picked up for my ride! Aren't they supposed to pick me up from my location? I ran with arms full of packages to four different locations. The driver was most likely unfamiliar with area, thus the reason for the many changes. I couldn't keep up with the driver's request for different locations via foot. I finally sent a text to the driver for clarification."
1,Uber has really been difficult. I would like to use my account to order food but the number associated with my account is almost 5 years old. I haven't had that number in AT LEAST 3 years but they will not allow me to change it because according to support the only way to change it is through the app. So I download the app and enter my number but obviously that doesn't work cause it's not associated with my email. It is however associated with the driver account I attempted to make but there was no email associated with that account because the process was not finished.
0,"The vehicles were all clean over our recent trip to Washington DC. The drivers were all kind and friendly... Overall, it was a much nicer experience than the cab rides."
0,"I have used several ride share companies and believe it's the best idea for travel, whether short or long distances. The drivers were always on time for pickup and drop-off to all destinations, were always polite, informative, and cordial but most importantly, I always felt safe because they were registered with a business who does background checks, would provide photos of the car and driver, accepted all forms of payment, conveniently provide their app on smart phones, and rating scale for satisfaction."
0,I used Uber when I had no ride to my post op visit and couldn't drive yet. It was a lifesaver! I got to my appointment in time and caught another driver back. It seemed a lot to spend $50 round trip but also a necessity when I couldn't drive.
0,"Uber is not only an excellent service, it has been for me one of the most important service I can't live without it, practical and all my experiences up to today very good, with very kind and respectful drivers."
0,Usually excellent. The one time I had a driver who went 2 hours out of the way (while I fell asleep) the charge was enormous. Uber credited me back within 2 days.
0,"I usually have good experiences with Uber. Drivers are pleasant and cars are clean and on time. My only complaint is the extremely high rates at peak times. I had one trip where it was $60 to the event and $315 to return home. Obviously, I had to find another way to get home."
0,I used Uber for travel to and from airports. It is a great way to get to my planes or final destination that is often a good distance from the airports.
1,I have only used this occasionally in a few cities and each time the experience was well worth it. The description of the car and the estimate of cost were both great. The cars were clean and modern and the driver was courteous.
1,"I've been using Uber for years to take trips home from the store. It's a really convenient app for me, especially because I don't have a car. The drivers are almost always nice. I think it's been so rare for me to have a bad experience with someone. Also, probably the one feature I have not been a fan of us is seeing my customer rating, gives me a bit of anxiety. Overall it's a good service. I've almost never had to wait more than 10 minutes too. The prices have gone up but I am thinking (and hoping) this is because they will pay drivers better."
1,The drivers were fine. The problem was I could not speak to a live person. It was very frustrating not to be able to talk to a person. On occasion it took me over 2 hrs to book a ride. Their system went haywire.
1,It is a good service but the website or app has very little on questions from users. It is very difficult to see if the service is good or not through the website. You need to try it first and the service keeps on changing without notice. Which in some ways is great but no upfront info or call in to talk to.
0,"Uber works. I have used it in several places around the world. It is usually cheap, convenient and hassle-free. However, surge pricing can get out of hand. Also, I'm not convinced that they treat their drivers fairly."
0,Car was dirty inside and the air conditioning did not work. The price was fine but I expected a much more desirable vehicle. I am glad there wasn't some with me because the back seat was full of clothes and sports gear.
0,"DON'T EVER USE UBER!!!! They don't hold any of their drivers accountable for their actions and they are dismissive and unprofessional when you try to contact them to resolve an issue or complaint! I had an uber driver damage my BMW in a hit and run and uber did NOTHING to resolve the issue. They couldn't  even apologize on her behalf! I had a description of the driver, her SUV, video footage from the hotel, witness statements, pictures of her car before she fled and they still can't compensate me in any way, let alone apologize! I mentioned that I had to seek medical attention and they don't show any sympathy or concern for my well-being! If this driver didn't have something to hide (i.e. drunk, drugs, weapons in the car etc) then why would she run knowing there were cameras at the hotel and multiple staff who saw her and told she was wrong and she saw me taking a pic of her SUV!? What's even more ridiculous is they don't consider their drivers as their ""employees""! Read this for yourself ""Driver-partners are considered as independent contractors and not employees. This technically means that driver partners are not employed by Uber Technologies, Inc or one of its respective company subsidiaries.Also, please be advised that the Incident response team is the sole entity in charge of handling all accidents and property damage claims. All claims that we handle are processed based on facts, reason, and logic.This being said, some customers that are emotionally invested in the situation can take this as a lack of empathy. Their need to be heard and understood will often outweigh their ability to focus on the details of the problem.Lastly, if you would want to directly speak to our CEO you need to find a different channel to do so as we are unable to cater to your request. I trust I've been able to explain our position clearly.""Ps. Pray you don't ever get in an accident with an uber driver in vegas because the useless cops and laws here will allow these drunk/high uber drivers commit crimes!!!! LVPD doesn't give a fck about driving under the influence. 
FCKN UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!! FCK UBER AND CAN'T WAIT FOR THESE FCKS TO GET THEIR DAY IN HELL AND GO BANKRUPT!"
1,"I was planning on taking an Uber to Midway airport on my recent trip to Chicago. I was planning on leaving at noon. I checked what it would cost me around 11:30. I was quoted $35. 20 min later when I got down to the lobby and ordered my Uber, the price jumped to $58! I switched to Lyft which was only minimally cheaper. Next time I will leave myself more time and take the train! Very disappointed because I really enjoyed taking Uber from the airport. Never again! Taxis are cheaper!"
0,I have used it regularly especially in Europe. Found it to be quick and efficient at a fair price. Have only had one issue where language was a major issue and we were put out a mile from our destination.
1,"Not a regular user of Uber but the five times. Uber it was convenient, safe, and reasonable priced. Much less than a DUI and paying for airport parking."
1,"I gave a tip to a driver and he was almost very thankful, told me it is rare to get a tip because Uber does not encourage it. Most everyone should be encourage to tip if the service is provided."
1,The first time they left me because I wasn't outside fast enough and when I did the app again that morning the price had gone up. Time was of the essence because I needed to get to the airport. I then took a shared ride. That's when I learned what that means and everyone wasn't going to the airport.
1,The Uber app has the help option but only accommodates a number of preset problem configurations and absolutely nothing outside of it. I had an issue where I was grossly overcharged for a ride. Now there was construction in the area but the driver admitted that he was completely unfamiliar with the area and therefore his lack of knowledge was the more significant reason for my delay.
0,"Ease of use is great, being able to not have money change hands and can tip online is a huge plus. The cars are clean and the drivers are respectful. Never have had to wait more than ten minutes."
1,Needed to use it to go to a running store for a Packet Pickup... driver very courteous and good driver on the freeways and to find the place. It only took a couple minutes to get my packet and he agreed to stay and return me to my hotel where I got the pickup from. I was pleased with the service he provided and gave him a nice tip. There was no other potential way for me to get to the Packet Pickup unless I used a taxi and I'm positive that would have cost quite a bit more. Place was about 30 minutes away.
0,"Convenience, on-time performance, easy to hail a ride, competitive pricing with a regular taxicab. Helpful drivers too. App also makes it super easy to find a ride in minutes."
1,"I buy gift cards for my son and he uses them quite often. I have had problems a couple times, but it is usually on my end. But when I call for help, they are great. They handle it very quickly. He has only had problems with a couple drivers, but other than that both of us are very happy with the service."
0,"Uber was a life saver when we needed it. The drivers were all wonderful courteous people but the company was not so great. There is no way to get help or even talk to someone from the company and the app was difficult to navigate. There were added fees like Uber technology fee that were not explained or mentioned that was just taken out of our account. There wasn't even a way to ask about it and the drivers got none of the extra money!! Lastly, I kept getting strange texts for Uber codes after I began the process of trying to be a driver. I changed my mind when I found out someone was already trying to hack my account and rack up an unknown amount of charges on it. I will not use Uber again unless it is like the last time I had to do it an emergency with no other options."
1,"The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89. There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience."
1,I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Uber at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company.
0,All the convenience of a taxi at half the price. They are there in minutes rather than the unknown taxi ETA. They are always friendly. The cars are usually clean and smell good. I don't ever use taxis anymore. You can schedule a day and time to be picked up too. And that's very nice.
0,I have only had one ride experience I wish not to repeat - I love the ease of getting a ride and the efficiency of the drivers. The costs are always reasonable as well. I will definitely use Uber in my future.
0,Both of my Uber drivers were prompt. The conversation was great! They made my ride very pleasant and enjoyable. Also my car was down at the time and they were a big help!
0,"They found me just fine. Only had one time where they couldn't find me, but someone else found me. And I got home just fine. And he waited until I got inside. He made me feel very comfortable."
1,"The driver ""cancelled"" and they charge me a cancellation free!! - I use the App for an Uber to pick me up from a gated community. The application directs me to a pickup intersection about 1/4 mile from my current location (on a very hot muggy night). I arrive there but me driver. After a 10 minute wait, I get a ""ride cancelled"" message from the App. At the time of the message notification, I see the driver on the App about a mile away at one of the entrances."
1,The driver that picked me up was not the driver listed on the app which means there is no security. The driver had lended his car to another to use his Uber. I also brought home bedbugs from the filthy cab. Very dangerous for woman and older individuals...
0,"The app and the information it provides are invaluable. I know how much my fare will be, who is picking me up, where they are and the actual route they are taking me. What's not to love?"
1,My main complaint would be the fact that each ride are different and prices at different times. Meaning I can go to Walmart today at 5 p.m. from home and it can cost for example $7 then I can go to the exact same Walmart from home on a different date and that ride will cost $13. Or I'll take a ride from home to Walmart and it cost $7 then when I go to get a ride from Walmart to home the ride will cost $13. No. I don't understand how the prices can fluctuate so much.
1,They charge me $35:00 for an eight-mile trip. When the request was made it was eight dollars. When the driver showed the final figure it was seventeen. When I saw the final charges it was 35:00. Uber is horrible in my opinion.
1,"I thought that some of my trips were overpriced due to the fact that I was going such a short distance, but understand that this is how the driver gets paid! But the surge pricing was outrageous and would always wait a few extra minutes for it to lower as I wasn't about to pay sometimes 15.00 or more for a mile and a half ride!"
1,"In Las Vegas airport Uber pickup area... The Uber guy told me he was my ride but that was not true. He had another person he was picking up, when they arrived they were too big for us all to be in car. So he made me take my luggage from his trunk and call another Uber. He was Never my driver but I didn't know that. (They all looked alike.) I wish I had his name."
1,I have had at least 2 drivers come on to me in a sexual manner. Another kept calling me at home to go out with him. Don't know how he got my number. Will never use Uber again. Only Lyft.
0,Every time I have used this service I have had a great experience. I have met wonderful drivers who are always friendly and polite. Rates are far better than taxis and much more convenient.
1,We used Uber to and from the airport in Philadelphia in December. It was quick and convenient. But this is my only experience with them. I went with my boyfriend. I'm not sure if I'd feel as secure if I'd been alone. I don't feel like they do a thorough background check on drivers. I've heard too many stories where the passenger is harassed or hurt.
0,A very convenient service. The cab industry got out-maneuvered. They could have/should have started the same type of service using their cabbies. Uber is also relatively inexpensive to use.
0,"I get severe, sudden onset migraines. Sometimes I have to go to the emergency room and there is no one home to drive me there and home again. The Uber drivers have always been very polite, kind, and careful. I have never had any qualms about getting into the car."
1,"I travelled with Uber driver Girish on 15th July 2018 in Pune, from Karvenagar to Pune airport. After the trip was completed, the driver asked for amount Rs. 340, and he did not mention anything about charging from my linked credit card. I paid the entire amount of Rs 340 to the driver in cash. NOW UBER IS CHARGING ME SECOND TIME FOR THE SAME TRIP, HORRIBLE CHEATING which is illegal, unethical, immoral and totally unjustified! They have refused to even talk with the concerned driver, and are constantly harassing me to pay the double amount for absolutely no reason."
0,I have had four very good Uber rides. The website is easy to use and a driver usually shows up pretty quickly. I had to wait once because there was no available drivers but the wait wasn't long. So far so good.
0,"Uber is easy, less expensive and they don't stink. Always on time, never sultry or obnoxious. Taxis are obsolete and the only time I would take a taxi is if I could not find an Uber ride."
0,"The service was great, the driver was appropriately friendly, cost was good too. The car was clean as well. I appreciated the service. I have recommended the service and would use again myself."
0,"Uber is fast and easy! There is nothing like it and now we can't live without it! Uber will be here forever! Uber can take you to and from the airport, take you to and from the grocery store, to and from night spots, to and from sporting events, to and from funerals, to and from wedding receptions, to and from the baby showers, to and from Christmas parties, pool parties, New Year's Eve parties, office parties, On and on and on! We love Uber ask a mission point."
0,Am so grateful to have Uber. But wish they had a phone number. The drivers have been great. Cars have been clean and comfortable. I don't drive and will use Uber fairly often.
0,"Overall my experience with Uber is wonderful with the exception of my 1st attempt, while I was trying to figure out the app, and got charged for a trip I cancelled within 3 MIN!"
0,"Although it may be a perception it seems safer. Most of the drivers I have met seem like nice likable people. Cars are much cleaner, not like cabs in Chicago."
0,I have had very successfully rides with Uber. Very dependable and safe drivers. Downloaded app is very easy to use. Responsibly priced and would definitely use them again.
1,"For the most part I find the drivers to be friendly, professional and careful. Also, they arrive promptly. However, occasionally a driver speaks about political views which is inappropriate conversation. I experienced this in London but the local drivers haven't discussed touchy topics."
0,Awesome for going out with friends and no one wants to drive because we're drinking. Show you the driver's face and make of the car so you know exactly who's picking you up.
0,"The driver was very knowledgeable about the area, great conversation. The car was clean and had a nice scent. He was on time, opened the door and even offered mints."
1,Used Uber on a family vacation in Boston and got great service from where we dropped off our rental car to the north end where having to drive is totally crazy. Driver really knew his way around. I use to live there so I knew he was not going off the beaten path.
0,"Had problems with Uber app. Driver was great, friendly, courteous and on time, he but had the wrong directions. I wonder if I was overcharged. Have no idea how much I was charged."
0,"I like the service. In the app you can track the cab, the driver's picture as well as the make/model of the car. Before you enter you're given a short description about the driver. And at the end of the ride you have the option of rating the driver. Definitely would recommend Uber!"
0,"I've used Uber in several cities New York, Chicago, Orlando, Miami, Boston, Las Vegas. I feel safer when I can see a picture and car description in a society where it is so unsafe for women traveling alone. In Vegas it was the cheapest way to get to and from the airport. Boston didn't allow airport pickup but I got one to return to airport, a savings of $20. If the cabs want to compete they need to adjust their rates and make us feel safer."
0,"Very useful, took several short trips, drivers very willing to help, tracking info on smartphone really great, drivers offered to charge my phone, give directions too."
0,"I've had 90% great rides. The other 10% were either rude or acted like you were bothering them asking for a ride. I've had the worse experiences with Middle Eastern men who don't seem to like women questioning/telling them anything. But, to each their own."
0,"While I have encountered a few minor issues, they were indeed minor. I love the ease in calling for a ride, my options in selecting the kind of ride I want [when I do grocery shopping I ride alone so I have room for my groceries & get right home]. Paying & tipping is easy. Every driver has been great; their cars are always clean & modern [never a beater]. Always smoke-free."
0,I have been a devoted customer in Canada and the US. I have had continual operational issues in Calgary. My house in downtown Calgary doesn't even work on their maps. New drivers get lost 75 percent of the time to the international airport. The biggest complaint I have is today I waited about an hour to receive a ride 4 km away from my house. l should have walked. Through their incredible incompetence they charged me a cancellation fee as I'm standing directly under the address sign for over 30 minutes. I just hope people stop using an unsafe and unreliable mode of travel in the future.
0,"Rudest, most ignorant and have had 3 or 4 that drive past & LEAVE you stranded particularly IF it IS A RIDE SHARE. THOSE ARE the most economical however some drivers don't want to take them."
0,Fast and low cost service. Used five times so far and always reliable. Sure beats taxis. Drivers were very professional and easy to work with. Paying for the ride with my credit card and the map showing where my driver is relative to picking me up are nice features.
0,"We have used this service frequently in several cities. So far it has largely been very positive. Most cars, prompt, clean, safe and the drivers courteous. No major complaints. The timing is sometimes off...they come too quickly and are impatient or are slightly late. For the most part, it is good to excellent. Keep the prices down to have an edge over other taxi services."
1,"If there is an issue there is no way to contact anyone except by email. A driver in Tanpa had a car that should have not been approved, did not assist with bags. The day after my flight home, he put in a ticket for a ride which of course was a know-how for which I was billed. I had to email ISO of speaking to someone to resolve this which they did."
0,"My grandson who is 19, took care of the computer/iPad stuff in Texas, smooth as clockwork, priced very fair. Both from Houston to Dallas and round trip."
0,I needed a medical transportation vehicle. They were the cheapest by far and they were trained professionals. The cost was approximately 10% of what transport services was charging.
0,I have always had a good experience with Uber. There was only one time when the driver drove way too fast. It seems as if he was annoyed to have to do this fair so early in the morning. But otherwise... Uber is great!
1,I love the app. Uber is a great way for getting around and it's still somewhat economical. Great in Dallas but not so good in Tucson where I was not able to get an Uber early morning pick up to the airport.
0,"The driver I had was professional, friendly, and personable. He made sure we were safe in his car, got to our destination safely. I would definitely use this car service again."
0,"Our drivers, two different ones, were very polite, helpful and interesting. Now I love Uber! We had quite a bit of luggage and three people. Loaded everything in comfortably."
0,Baltimore drivers are not as courteous as Dallas drivers but overall pretty good! About 3-5 months ago it was a problem that my drivers would not show in the early morning hours in Charleston SC that need to be addressed/tweeted; also asking for a tip is not proper etiquette if you're good then it's no need to ask but if you do not acknowledge me as a person I will not tip!
1,"As a disabled person, when in SF, Uber and Lyft are often the only choice I have. I prefer to call or hail a taxi, but that's not always possible. However, Uber's existence has caused a marked increase in traffic, making it harder to get around and customer service is non-existent."
0,"I had no problem with my Uber experience except the car was very strong smoke smell. Must of been in seats because my clothes smelled like stale cigarette smoke. It was a very nice car, clean, driver was a very polite/courtesy young man. I use Uber and will continue. Everyone has been great."
0,"The driver didn't speak when I got in the car, he was very disrespectful. I went out one night and had on one of my good outfits and when he saw me he said something smart about what I had on."
